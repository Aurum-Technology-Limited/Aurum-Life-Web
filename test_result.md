Fixed all field selections to match actual database schema. Applied performance-first approach: rapid Redis connectivity check via socket, fast-fail timeouts, improved asyncio.wait_for usage, memory cache optimization.

    -message: "üö® FOCUSED LOGIN/REGISTER UX TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL DUPLICATE EMAIL AUTO-SWITCH ISSUES IDENTIFIED! Executed comprehensive E2E testing of login/register page UX updates as requested in review. TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WORKING: Successfully navigated to login screen, Sign Up tab switching functional, form submission working, 409 error correctly returned from server for duplicate email (marc.alleyne@aurumtechnologyltd.com), email field preservation working correctly ‚úÖ 'SIGN IN INSTEAD' LINK BEHAVIOR (100% SUCCESS): Sign Up tab displays 'Sign in instead' button correctly, clicking link successfully switches to Login tab, password field receives focus properly - this functionality is working perfectly ‚ùå CRITICAL DUPLICATE EMAIL AUTO-SWITCH FAILURES (0% SUCCESS): Despite 409 error being returned and tab switching to Login occurring, the following critical UX features are NOT working: 1) Auto-switched indicator [data-testid='auto-switched-to-login'] not found - justAutoSwitched state not being set properly, 2) Duplicate tip [data-testid='duplicate-tip'] not visible - autoSwitchedDuplicate state not being set correctly, 3) Password field not cleared after auto-switch - still contains 'TestPassword123!' instead of being empty, 4) Password field not receiving focus after auto-switch. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The backend correctly returns 409 error with duplicate:true and code:409 properties. The register function in BackendAuthContext.js properly handles this. However, the setTimeout logic in Login.jsx (lines 120-128) that should set justAutoSwitched=true and autoSwitchedDuplicate=true is not executing properly. The tab switch IS happening (Login tab becomes active), but the state management for the UX indicators is failing. IMPACT: Users experiencing duplicate email registration will see the tab switch to Login (which works) but will NOT see the helpful duplicate tip message, the password field won't be cleared/focused, and there's no visual indication that an auto-switch occurred. This creates a confusing user experience. URGENT FIXES REQUIRED: 1) Debug why justAutoSwitched and autoSwitchedDuplicate states are not being set in the setTimeout callback, 2) Ensure password field clearing logic works properly, 3) Verify duplicate-tip JSX structure and visibility conditions, 4) Test focus management for password field after auto-switch. SUCCESS CRITERIA: Navigation and basic functionality (100%), 'Sign in instead' link behavior (100%), Duplicate email auto-switch core UX features (0% - CRITICAL BLOCKER). The duplicate email auto-switch feature requires immediate debugging and repair to provide the intended user experience."

Waited 10 seconds, clicked Pillars again to force refresh - pillar still not visible. Screenshots confirm existing pillars visible but new pillar never appeared. ROOT CAUSE: The setQueryData fallback mechanism (lines 66-80 in Pillars.jsx) is not working correctly. Despite successful backend operations, proper query invalidation, and fallback fetch attempts, there's a deeper issue with the UI rendering logic where TanStack Query data is not properly updating component state. IMPACT: Complete pillar creation workflow remains broken for users - they cannot see newly created pillars despite successful backend operations. This blocks the entire hierarchical entity creation system. URGENT INVESTIGATION REQUIRED: Need to verify if pillars are actually being persisted in backend database and debug TanStack Query data flow to identify why created pillars don't appear in UI despite successful API operations, cache invalidation, and setQueryData fallback. TEST RESULT: FAIL - setQueryData fallback mechanism is not resolving the UI display bug."

WORKING COMPONENTS: Form submission successful with 409 error returned correctly, Login tab activation works (tab switches), Password field cleared properly. FAILING COMPONENTS: Auto-switched indicator [data-testid='auto-switched-to-login'] NOT found - justAutoSwitched state not being set, Duplicate tip [data-testid='duplicate-tip'] NOT visible - autoSwitchedDuplicate state not being set, Email prefill FAILING - field empty instead of containing marc.alleyne@aurumtechnologyltd.com, Password field NOT receiving focus after auto-switch. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The backend correctly returns 409 error and the tab switching logic works (Login tab becomes active). However, the useEffect logic in Login.jsx lines 28-42 that should handle the UX enhancements when pendingAutoSwitchDuplicate=true and isLogin=true is not executing properly. The setTimeout in lines 145-147 sets pendingAutoSwitchDuplicate=true and switches tabs, but the effect that should set justAutoSwitched=true and autoSwitchedDuplicate=true is not triggering. IMPACT: Users experiencing duplicate email registration see the tab switch to Login (which works) but miss all the helpful UX indicators: no duplicate tip message, no email prefill, no password focus, no visual indication of auto-switch. This creates a confusing user experience. URGENT FIXES REQUIRED: Debug the useEffect dependency array and state management in Login.jsx lines 28-42, verify pendingAutoSwitchDuplicate state transitions, ensure lastRegEmailRef.current is properly set and used for email prefill, fix password field focus logic after auto-switch.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The backend correctly returns 409 error with duplicate detection. The register function in BackendAuthContext.js properly handles this with result.duplicate || result.code === 409 check. However, the setTimeout logic in Login.jsx (lines 120-134) that should set justAutoSwitched=true and autoSwitchedDuplicate=true after 1200ms is not executing properly. The tab switch IS happening (Login tab becomes active), but the state management for UX indicators and email preservation is failing. IMPACT: Users experiencing duplicate email registration will see the tab switch to Login (which works) but will NOT see the helpful duplicate tip message, the email field won't be preserved, password field won't be cleared/focused, and there's no visual indication that an auto-switch occurred. This creates a confusing user experience where users lose their email input and don't understand why they're suddenly on the Login tab. URGENT FIXES REQUIRED: 1) Debug why justAutoSwitched and autoSwitchedDuplicate states are not being set in the setTimeout callback, 2) Fix email field preservation logic to maintain email value during auto-switch, 3) Ensure password field clearing and focus management works properly, 4) Verify duplicate-tip JSX structure and visibility conditions.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The effect-based implementation (useEffect lines 28-42 in Login.jsx) is not executing properly. Despite pendingAutoSwitchDuplicate being set to true and the tab switch occurring, the effect that should set justAutoSwitched=true and autoSwitchedDuplicate=true is not running. This suggests an issue with the effect dependencies or timing. The lastRegEmailRef.current email preservation is also not working.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Error: 'element intercepts pointer events' preventing Create button clicks. This appears to be a z-index or modal layering issue where form elements are blocking the submit button. ‚ùå SUBSEQUENT CRUD OPERATIONS BLOCKED: Due to Areas form submission failure, could not proceed with complete hierarchical CRUD workflow verification (Areas ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Tasks). Modal overlay remained open preventing navigation to other sections. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The Areas form modal has UI layering issues where form elements (labels, textareas) are intercepting pointer events and preventing the Create button from being clicked. This is a frontend modal implementation issue, not a backend problem. The data-testid hooks are working correctly, but the modal's CSS z-index or positioning is causing interaction problems. IMPACT: Complete hierarchical CRUD workflow is partially blocked due to Areas form submission UI issue. Users can access and fill the form but cannot submit it due to element interception. URGENT UI FIX REQUIRED: The Areas modal needs CSS fixes to resolve element layering issues preventing form submission. The modal overlay or form element positioning needs adjustment to allow proper button interactions. SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED: Authentication flow (100%), Pillar CRUD with data-testid hooks (100%), Data-testid selector reliability (100%), Areas form accessibility (100%). FAILED CRITERIA: Areas form submission (0% - blocked by UI modal issue), Complete hierarchical CRUD workflow (0% - blocked by modal submission failure).

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The setQueryData fallback mechanism (lines 66-80 in Pillars.jsx) is not working correctly. Despite successful backend operations, proper query invalidation, and fallback fetch attempts, there's a deeper issue with the UI rendering logic where the TanStack Query data is not properly updating the component state. This could be due to: 1) Backend not actually persisting the pillar despite returning success, 2) Query cache not properly updating despite invalidation and setQueryData, 3) Component not re-rendering with updated data, 4) Race condition between create and fetch operations.

Investigation reveals: Pillars are being created successfully in backend (confirmed by network responses), Modal forms submit without errors and close properly, However, UI still shows 'No pillars yet' empty state despite successful creation. ROOT CAUSE: Frontend display logic issue where created pillars are not appearing in the UI list despite successful backend operations.

Waited 10 seconds checking every second, then clicked Pillars again to force refresh - pillar still not visible. Pillar count remained at 5 existing pillars, new pillar never appeared. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The queryClient invalidation fix (lines 63-64 in Pillars.jsx) is working correctly - console shows successful API calls and cache invalidation. However, there's a deeper issue with the UI rendering logic where the TanStack Query data is not properly updating the component state or the query is not returning the newly created pillar. This could be due to: 1) Backend not actually persisting the pillar despite returning success, 2) Query cache not properly updating despite invalidation, 3) Component not re-rendering with updated data, 4) Race condition between create and fetch operations. IMPACT: Complete pillar creation workflow remains broken for users - they cannot see newly created pillars despite successful backend operations and proper cache invalidation. This blocks the entire hierarchical entity creation system.

All endpoints verify user ownership via Supabase queries before allowing access, return 404 (not 403) to prevent resource enumeration attacks. CSRF Protection: Added Double Submit Cookie pattern with CSRFProtectionMiddleware generating secure random tokens on login, storing in httpOnly=false cookie. Frontend API client updated to automatically include X-CSRF-Token header for state-changing requests. Backend validates cookie matches header or rejects with 403. Development mode temporarily bypassed for testing. Hardened CSP: Removed unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval from Content-Security-Policy, restricted script-src and style-src to 'self' and trusted domains only (Google OAuth, Google Fonts).

  critical_issue: "Network connectivity between frontend and backend in containerized environment"

## STATUS SUMMARY:

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES:
1. **Insights Backend Error**: Fixed MongoDB import issue in InsightsService - API now returns comprehensive data
2. **Database Errors**: All MongoDB syntax errors and foreign key constraint violations resolved
3. **Authentication**: Marc user can login successfully with reset password
4. **Error Messages**: Eliminated "Error Loading Insights" message - page renders properly
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Added API performance tracking and slow request detection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMAINING ISSUE:
**Network Connectivity**: Frontend browser cannot reach backend APIs in containerized environment
- External URL: Requests hang and timeout (net::ERR_ABORTED)
- Localhost: Returns 404 (different container contexts)  
- Proxy: Requests timeout after 8 seconds
- Root Cause: Browser networking restrictions in Kubernetes container setup

### üìä PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
1. **Robust API Client**: Retry logic, timeout detection, performance monitoring
2. **Request Optimization**: Reduced timeouts, added caching headers
3. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful degradation
4. **Loading States**: Proper skeleton loading instead of error states

### üéØ NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
1. **Infrastructure Fix**: Resolve container networking to enable frontend-backend communication
2. **Alternative Architecture**: Consider server-side rendering or API gateway solution
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Implement offline mode with cached data for performance

The core application logic is working - the issue is purely network connectivity in the deployment environment.

      message: "üîç UNIFIED PROJECT VIEWS TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES IDENTIFIED. Comprehensive testing revealed that the unified state management system is partially working (84.5% success rate) but has critical backend limitations. KEY FINDINGS: ‚úÖ Core unified state management works correctly - tasks appear in both list and kanban views when created successfully, data synchronization between views is functional, project task counts update accurately. ‚ùå CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES: 1) Backend TaskStatusEnum is incomplete - only supports 'in_progress', 'completed', 'not_started' but frontend expects 'todo', 'review' statuses, 2) Kanban board structure missing 'review' column (only has to_do, in_progress, done), 3) Task creation fails for 'todo' and 'review' statuses with unknown errors. USER ISSUES ASSESSMENT: The reported issue 'Task creation in Kanban view doesn't work' is partially true - it works for supported statuses but fails for unsupported ones. The issue 'Tasks created in List view don't show up in Kanban view' is false - tasks do appear correctly when created successfully. ROOT CAUSE: Backend-frontend status enum mismatch. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Update backend TaskStatusEnum in models.py to include 'todo' and 'review' statuses, update kanban board structure to include 'review' column, ensure all status transitions are supported. The unified state management architecture is sound - this is a data model compatibility issue."

CODE ANALYSIS CONFIRMS IMPLEMENTATION: Layout.jsx contains all requested sidebar improvements - fixed positioning (position: fixed, top: 0, left: 0, z-index: 40), collapse functionality with width transitions, mobile responsiveness with overlay, smooth transitions, gradient active states, and proper user menu. All features from review request are implemented correctly in code. CRITICAL BLOCKER: Cannot verify actual functionality without working authentication. Main agent must resolve authentication system before sidebar testing can proceed. Sidebar implementation appears correct but needs functional verification once users can successfully log in and access dashboard."

Modal overlay remained open preventing navigation to other sections. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The Areas form modal has UI layering issues where form elements (labels, textareas) are intercepting pointer events and preventing the Create button from being clicked. This is a frontend modal implementation issue, not a backend problem. The data-testid hooks are working correctly, but the modal's CSS z-index or positioning is causing interaction problems. IMPACT: Complete hierarchical CRUD workflow is partially blocked due to Areas form submission UI issue. Users can access and fill the form but cannot submit it due to element interception. URGENT UI FIX REQUIRED: The Areas modal needs CSS fixes to resolve element layering issues preventing form submission. The modal overlay or form element positioning needs adjustment to allow proper button interactions. SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED: Authentication flow (100%), Pillar CRUD with data-testid hooks (100%), Data-testid selector reliability (100%), Areas form accessibility (100%).

The issue is NOT with: Authentication (working perfectly), Backend API (HTTP 200 responses, successful mutations), Form submission (working correctly), Data-testid hooks (all functional), Z-index on submit button (present). The issue IS with: Frontend UI rendering logic not updating after successful area creation, TanStack Query cache not properly reflecting created areas in component state, Component not re-rendering with new data despite successful cache invalidation. IMPACT: Complete Areas CRUD workflow appears broken to users - they cannot see created areas despite successful backend operations. This blocks the entire hierarchical entity creation system (Areas ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Tasks).

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The Today prioritization API core functionality is working excellently with proper task scoring, breakdown analysis, and coaching features. However, the top_n query parameter is not being properly implemented in the backend endpoint, causing it to return all tasks regardless of the requested limit. IMPACT: Users requesting a specific number of prioritized tasks (e.g., top 3) will receive all tasks, potentially causing performance issues and poor user experience. The coaching and scoring features work correctly but the fundamental filtering is broken. URGENT FIX REQUIRED: Backend endpoint /api/today needs to properly implement the top_n parameter to limit the number of tasks returned. This is a critical user experience issue that affects the core purpose of the Today prioritization feature. SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED: Authentication (100%), API structure and response format (100%), Task field validation (100%), Coaching features (100%), Performance (100%), Zero tasks edge case (100%). FAILED CRITERIA: top_n parameter implementation (0% - CRITICAL BLOCKER). The Today Prioritization API has excellent core functionality but requires immediate fix for the top_n parameter to be production-ready."

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The major UI display bugs have been significantly resolved. Pillars are now visible and functional, Areas continue to work correctly, and Projects are accessible. The data-testid hooks are properly implemented and the cascade deletion dialog system is working correctly with proper warning messages.

      message: "üö® COMPREHENSIVE UI CASCADE DELETION TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUES IDENTIFIED! Executed automated UI cascade deletion tests as requested in review request using marc.alleyne@aurumtechnologyltd.com/password123 credentials covering all three test scenarios: Pillar cascade, Area cascade, and Project cascade deletion. TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION FLOW (100% SUCCESS): Successfully logged in with specified credentials, dashboard loaded correctly, JWT token generation working perfectly ‚úÖ EXISTING DATA STRUCTURE VERIFIED: Found 6 existing pillars with delete buttons using [data-testid='pillar-delete-*'] pattern, 6 areas with delete buttons, confirming UI elements are present and accessible ‚úÖ CONFIRMATION DIALOGS WORKING: Successfully detected and handled confirmation dialogs for cascade deletion - Area deletion dialog shows 'Are you sure? This will delete all projects and tasks in this area.' confirming proper cascade warning messages ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE - UI CASCADE DELETION NON-FUNCTIONAL: Despite successful confirmation dialog handling, cascade deletion operations are not completing in the UI. Pillar deletion test showed no change in pillar count (6 -> 6) after confirmation, indicating frontend deletion logic is not working properly ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE - MODAL OVERLAY INTERFERENCE: Encountered persistent modal overlay issues where pointer events are intercepted by modal backgrounds, preventing proper click actions on delete buttons and form submissions ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE - UI DISPLAY BUG PERSISTS: The known UI display bug where created entities don't appear in lists also affects the cascade deletion testing workflow, making it impossible to create complete test hierarchies for comprehensive cascade testing ‚ùå TIMEOUT ISSUES: Multiple timeout errors during testing indicate UI responsiveness problems and potential JavaScript execution issues affecting the deletion workflow. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The frontend cascade deletion functionality appears to have multiple critical issues: 1) Delete button click handlers may not be properly connected to backend API calls, 2) Modal overlay CSS z-index issues preventing proper user interactions, 3) TanStack Query cache invalidation not working correctly after deletions, 4) UI state management issues preventing proper re-rendering after successful deletions. IMPACT: Complete UI cascade deletion workflow is broken for end users. While backend cascade deletion works perfectly (97.1% success rate), the frontend interface prevents users from successfully executing cascade deletions, making the feature non-functional from a user experience perspective. URGENT FRONTEND FIXES REQUIRED: 1) Debug and fix delete button click handlers to ensure proper API calls, 2) Resolve modal overlay CSS issues preventing user interactions, 3) Fix TanStack Query cache invalidation after deletion operations, 4) Implement proper UI state updates after successful cascade deletions, 5) Add proper error handling and user feedback for deletion operations. SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED: Authentication flow (100%), Confirmation dialog detection (100%), Data structure verification (100%). FAILED CRITERIA: Pillar cascade deletion UI (0% - critical blocker), Area cascade deletion UI (0% - critical blocker), Project cascade deletion UI (0% - critical blocker), Complete cascade deletion workflow (0% - completely non-functional). OVERALL TEST RESULT: FAIL - UI cascade deletion functionality is completely broken and requires immediate frontend development attention despite perfect backend functionality."

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The localStorage safety net is working correctly - localStorage['auth_prefill_email'] is properly set with the duplicate email. However, the effect that should hydrate the email field from localStorage (lines 44-53 in Login.jsx) is not executing properly. The pendingAutoSwitchDuplicate state management and the effect dependencies may not be triggering the email prefill logic correctly. IMPACT: Users experiencing duplicate email registration will see the tab switch to Login and localStorage will contain their email, but the email field will be empty, requiring manual re-entry. The duplicate tip and auto-switch indicators are also missing, creating a confusing UX. CRITICAL SUCCESS: localStorage email prefill safety net is functional and storing the duplicate email correctly as requested. The core auto-switch mechanism works, but the UI hydration from localStorage needs debugging. SUCCESS CRITERIA: Test A localStorage safety net (100% - CRITICAL SUCCESS), Test A overall UX (40% - needs improvement), Test B sign in instead (100% - PERFECT).
