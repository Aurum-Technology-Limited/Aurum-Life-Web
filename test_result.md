# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Added timing settings (reminder advance time, overdue check interval, quiet hours), delivery channels (browser/email), and save functionality with API integration. Updated backend models with achievement_notifications and unblocked_task_notifications fields in NotificationPreference model. Phase 1 (Backend Implementation) - Added unblocked_task to NotificationTypeEnum for dependency completion notifications. Created comprehensive BrowserNotification models (BrowserNotification, BrowserNotificationCreate, BrowserNotificationResponse) for real-time notifications with related entity information, metadata, and state management. Enhanced notification_service.py with create_notification, get_user_browser_notifications, mark_notification_read, mark_all_notifications_read, delete_notification, and clear_all_notifications methods. Added automatic unblocked task detection in TaskService.update_task with _check_and_notify_unblocked_tasks method that checks for dependent tasks when a task is completed and sends notifications when all dependencies are satisfied. Phase 2 (Frontend Implementation) - Created comprehensive NotificationCenter.jsx component with modern dark UI, filtering (all/unread), individual notification actions (mark as read, delete), bulk actions (mark all read, clear all), notification icons and colors by type, time formatting, project context, and priority indicators. Enhanced frontend API with deleteNotification function. Added notifications navigation item to Layout.jsx with Bell icon import. Updated App.js with notification center routing and section titles.

KEY FINDINGS: ✅ Core unified state management works correctly - tasks appear in both list and kanban views when created successfully, data synchronization between views is functional, project task counts update accurately. ❌ CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES: 1) Backend TaskStatusEnum is incomplete - only supports 'in_progress', 'completed', 'not_started' but frontend expects 'todo', 'review' statuses, 2) Kanban board structure missing 'review' column (only has to_do, in_progress, done), 3) Task creation fails for 'todo' and 'review' statuses with unknown errors. USER ISSUES ASSESSMENT: The reported issue 'Task creation in Kanban view doesn't work' is partially true - it works for supported statuses but fails for unsupported ones. The issue 'Tasks created in List view don't show up in Kanban view' is false - tasks do appear correctly when created successfully. ROOT CAUSE: Backend-frontend status enum mismatch. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Update backend TaskStatusEnum in models.py to include 'todo' and 'review' statuses, update kanban board structure to include 'review' column, ensure all status transitions are supported.

DETAILED DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS: ✅ BACKEND API CONNECTIVITY VERIFIED - Backend API fully accessible at https://25d39911-b77f-4948-aab8-0b3bcaee8f2f.preview.emergentagent.com/api, health check endpoint responding correctly with 'healthy' status, no connectivity issues detected ✅ USER REGISTRATION & LOGIN WORKING PERFECTLY - User registration with realistic test data (sarah.johnson_c88570cb@aurumlife.com) successful, user login generating valid JWT tokens (165 character bearer token), authentication flow working without any 401 errors ✅ JWT TOKEN VALIDATION CONFIRMED - Authentication token working correctly for protected endpoints, /api/auth/me endpoint validating tokens successfully, authenticated user data matching registered user, no token format or expiration issues ✅ PROJECTS API FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Projects API properly protected (403 without auth, success with auth), GET /api/projects returning correct data structure (empty list initially, populated after creation), project creation and retrieval working perfectly, no 401 authentication errors detected ✅ COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT DATA TESTING - Created test area 'Personal Development' and project 'Learning New Skills' successfully, project filtering by area_id working correctly, specific project details retrieval functional, all project CRUD operations working without errors ✅ ERROR SCENARIO INVESTIGATION - Invalid token formats properly rejected with 401 status, malformed tokens correctly handled, original valid tokens continue working after error tests, proper security validation in place ✅ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Backend authentication system working perfectly (100% success rate), all API endpoints accessible with proper authentication, no 401 errors in backend authentication flow, projects API returning data correctly. CONCLUSION: The 'Failed to load projects' issue is NOT caused by backend authentication problems. Backend authentication and projects API are fully functional. The issue is likely in: 1) Frontend not sending authentication tokens correctly, 2) Frontend authentication state management problems, or 3) Network/CORS issues between frontend and backend. RECOMMENDATION: Investigate frontend authentication token handling and API request implementation."

Comprehensive testing executed covering complete password reset email functionality as requested: ✅ ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION VERIFIED - SendGrid API key properly configured (SG.wBB6585OSeqa0S5EwMNhEw...), sender email configured (marc.alleyne@aurumtechnologyltd.com), configuration files contain correct values ✅ PASSWORD RESET REQUEST ENDPOINT WORKING - POST /api/auth/forgot-password endpoint responding correctly (status 200), proper success response structure with 'success: true', security implemented (same response for non-existent emails), request validation working correctly ✅ END-TO-END FLOW FUNCTIONAL - Complete password reset flow tested successfully, invalid token properly rejected, security measures in place, API endpoints responding as expected ✅ EMAIL TEMPLATE AND URL CONSTRUCTION - Multiple password reset requests processed successfully, template system working, URL construction functional ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: EMAIL SERVICE NOT SENDING REAL EMAILS - Email service running in mock mode despite SendGrid API key being configured, environment variables not loading correctly in email service initialization, 'object bool can't be used in 'await' expression' error in backend logs indicating async/await mismatch, emails being logged as '[MOCK EMAIL]' instead of being sent via SendGrid. ROOT CAUSE: Email service initialization occurs before environment variables are loaded, causing it to default to mock mode. IMPACT: Password reset functionality works from API perspective but actual emails are not being sent to users. RECOMMENDATION: Fix email service initialization to properly load environment variables and resolve async/await error in server.py line 160."
