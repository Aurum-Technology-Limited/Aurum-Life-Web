# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0

##     -agent: "main"
##     -message: "Fixed Google OAuth button width alignment issue. Updated Login.jsx to use width='100%' for both login and register Google buttons instead of hardcoded width='400'. Google buttons now match the full width of other form elements like email and password inputs. Ready for testing."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "🔍 UNIFIED PROJECT VIEWS TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES IDENTIFIED. Comprehensive testing revealed that the unified state management system is partially working (84.5% success rate) but has critical backend limitations. KEY FINDINGS: ✅ Core unified state management works correctly - tasks appear in both list and kanban views when created successfully, data synchronization between views is functional, project task counts update accurately. ❌ CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES: 1) Backend TaskStatusEnum is incomplete - only supports 'in_progress', 'completed', 'not_started' but frontend expects 'todo', 'review' statuses, 2) Kanban board structure missing 'review' column (only has to_do, in_progress, done), 3) Task creation fails for 'todo' and 'review' statuses with unknown errors. USER ISSUES ASSESSMENT: The reported issue 'Task creation in Kanban view doesn't work' is partially true - it works for supported statuses but fails for unsupported ones. The issue 'Tasks created in List view don't show up in Kanban view' is false - tasks do appear correctly when created successfully. ROOT CAUSE: Backend-frontend status enum mismatch. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Update backend TaskStatusEnum in models.py to include 'todo' and 'review' statuses, update kanban board structure to include 'review' column, ensure all status transitions are supported. The unified state management architecture is sound - this is a data model compatibility issue."

CONCLUSION: The 'Failed to load projects' issue is NOT caused by backend authentication problems. Backend authentication and projects API are fully functional.
