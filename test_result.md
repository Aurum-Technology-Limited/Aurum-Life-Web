# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  critical_issue: "Network connectivity between frontend and backend in containerized environment"

## STATUS SUMMARY:

### ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES:
1. **Insights Backend Error**: Fixed MongoDB import issue in InsightsService - API now returns comprehensive data
2. **Database Errors**: All MongoDB syntax errors and foreign key constraint violations resolved
3. **Authentication**: Marc user can login successfully with reset password
4. **Error Messages**: Eliminated "Error Loading Insights" message - page renders properly
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Added API performance tracking and slow request detection

### ⚠️ CRITICAL REMAINING ISSUE:
**Network Connectivity**: Frontend browser cannot reach backend APIs in containerized environment
- External URL: Requests hang and timeout (net::ERR_ABORTED)
- Localhost: Returns 404 (different container contexts)  
- Proxy: Requests timeout after 8 seconds
- Root Cause: Browser networking restrictions in Kubernetes container setup

### 📊 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
1. **Robust API Client**: Retry logic, timeout detection, performance monitoring
2. **Request Optimization**: Reduced timeouts, added caching headers
3. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful degradation
4. **Loading States**: Proper skeleton loading instead of error states

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
1. **Infrastructure Fix**: Resolve container networking to enable frontend-backend communication
2. **Alternative Architecture**: Consider server-side rendering or API gateway solution
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Implement offline mode with cached data for performance

The core application logic is working - the issue is purely network connectivity in the deployment environment.

Comprehensive targeted testing executed covering the DELETE /api/notifications/clear-all endpoint fix as requested in review: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED - Issue was FastAPI routing conflict: /notifications/clear-all was being matched by /notifications/{notification_id} route because 'clear-all' was treated as notification_id parameter. Fixed by moving clear-all endpoint BEFORE the parameterized route in server.py. Also removed duplicate clear_all_notifications method in notification_service.py that was causing conflicts. ✅ CLEAR-ALL WITH NOTIFICATIONS PRESENT WORKING - Endpoint now returns proper success response: {'success': True, 'message': 'Cleared 3 notifications', 'count': 3}, notifications are actually deleted from database (verified 0 remaining), correct count returned matching number of cleared notifications ✅ CLEAR-ALL WITH NO NOTIFICATIONS WORKING - Endpoint handles empty state correctly: {'success': True, 'count': 0}, no errors when no notifications exist to clear ✅ AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENT ENFORCED - Endpoint properly requires authentication (returns 403 without token), JWT token validation working correctly ✅ COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION - Created test notifications via task completion (dependency-based notifications), verified notifications exist before clear operation, confirmed complete deletion after clear operation, tested both populated and empty notification states. THE 404 ERROR BUG IS COMPLETELY FIXED! DELETE /api/notifications/clear-all endpoint is now working correctly and returning proper success responses with accurate counts instead of 404 errors.

Added timing settings (reminder advance time, overdue check interval, quiet hours), delivery channels (browser/email), and save functionality with API integration. Updated backend models with achievement_notifications and unblocked_task_notifications fields in NotificationPreference model. Phase 1 (Backend Implementation) - Added unblocked_task to NotificationTypeEnum for dependency completion notifications. Created comprehensive BrowserNotification models (BrowserNotification, BrowserNotificationCreate, BrowserNotificationResponse) for real-time notifications with related entity information, metadata, and state management. Enhanced notification_service.py with create_notification, get_user_browser_notifications, mark_notification_read, mark_all_notifications_read, delete_notification, and clear_all_notifications methods. Added automatic unblocked task detection in TaskService.update_task with _check_and_notify_unblocked_tasks method that checks for dependent tasks when a task is completed and sends notifications when all dependencies are satisfied. Phase 2 (Frontend Implementation) - Created comprehensive NotificationCenter.jsx component with modern dark UI, filtering (all/unread), individual notification actions (mark as read, delete), bulk actions (mark all read, clear all), notification icons and colors by type, time formatting, project context, and priority indicators. Enhanced frontend API with deleteNotification function. Added notifications navigation item to Layout.jsx with Bell icon import. Updated App.js with notification center routing and section titles. System provides complete user control over notification preferences, automatically detects and notifies about unblocked tasks when dependencies are completed, and offers comprehensive notification management interface.

USER ISSUES ASSESSMENT: The reported issue 'Task creation in Kanban view doesn't work' is partially true - it works for supported statuses but fails for unsupported ones. The issue 'Tasks created in List view don't show up in Kanban view' is false - tasks do appear correctly when created successfully. ROOT CAUSE: Backend-frontend status enum mismatch. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Update backend TaskStatusEnum in models.py to include 'todo' and 'review' statuses, update kanban board structure to include 'review' column, ensure all status transitions are supported.

RECOMMENDATION: Investigate frontend authentication token handling and API request implementation."

Task response shows 'recurrence': 'none' instead of recurrence_pattern data. ❌ VALIDATION ISSUE: Invalid recurrence patterns accepted instead of being rejected (should return 400/422 status).
