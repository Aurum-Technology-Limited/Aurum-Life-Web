# Aurum Life Logo Setup

## Logo Integration Complete âœ…

I've successfully updated both Layout.jsx and SimpleLayout.jsx components to use your golden brain logo image.

### What's Implemented:
1. **Image Logo Support**: Both components now load `/aurum-brain-logo.png` from the public folder
2. **Fallback System**: If the image fails to load, it gracefully falls back to the "AL" text logo
3. **Proper Sizing**: Logo is sized consistently at 32x32px (w-8 h-8) across both layouts
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures the app never breaks if the image is missing

### To Add Your Logo:
1. Save your golden brain logo image as `aurum-brain-logo.png` 
2. Place it in the `/app/frontend/public/` folder
3. The app will automatically display your logo instead of the "AL" text

### File Location:
```
/app/frontend/public/aurum-brain-logo.png  <- Place your logo here
```

### Supported Formats:
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG
- WebP

The logo will display throughout the application in both the main Layout and SimpleLayout components, giving Aurum Life a cohesive branded appearance!
