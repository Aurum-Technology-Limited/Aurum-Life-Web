Quick Capture Debug Panel - REMOVED

This component was previously used for debugging the quick capture functionality
but has been removed from the main dashboard to clean up the UI.

The quick capture feature itself is still fully functional and can be accessed through:
- The floating action button
- Dashboard quick capture buttons
- Direct openQuickCapture() calls from the enhanced features store

If debugging is needed, you can:
1. Temporarily add this component back to any dashboard
2. Use browser dev tools to inspect the enhancedFeaturesStore state
3. Use the TodayButtonDebug component which includes some quick capture monitoring
