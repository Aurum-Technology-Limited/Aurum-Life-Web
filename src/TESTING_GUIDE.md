## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, behavior-focused test names
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests consistently
3. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
4. **Mock Appropriately**: Mock external dependencies, not internals
5. **Test User Behavior**: Focus on user interactions, not implementation

### Accessibility Testing

1. **Automated + Manual**: Combine axe-core with manual testing
2. **Real Assistive Tech**: Test with actual screen readers when possible
3. **Keyboard Only**: Verify full functionality without mouse
4. **Color Blindness**: Test with color vision simulators
5. **Mobile Accessibility**: Touch targets and gesture alternatives

### Visual Regression

1. **Deterministic**: Use fixed dates, seeds, and dimensions
2. **Cross-browser**: Test visual consistency across browsers
3. **Responsive**: Capture multiple viewport sizes
4. **State Coverage**: Test loading, error, and success states
5. **Update Process**: Clear workflow for legitimate visual changes

### E2E Testing

1. **Real User Flows**: Test complete user journeys
2. **Error Recovery**: Test how users recover from failures
3. **Performance**: Monitor real-world performance metrics
4. **Mobile First**: Prioritize mobile user experience testing
5. **Accessibility**: Verify keyboard navigation and screen readers

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Jest Memory Issues**
```bash
# Increase memory limit
node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/jest
```

**Visual Test Failures**
```bash
# Update snapshots after legitimate changes
SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=true npm run test:visual
```

**Playwright Timeouts**
```bash
# Run with increased timeout for debugging
npx playwright test --timeout=60000
```

**Accessibility Test Failures**
- Check browser console for axe-core violations
- Use browser dev tools accessibility inspector
- Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

## 📋 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
- name: Run Enhanced Test Suite
  run: npm run test:all
  env:
    CI: true
    NODE_ENV: test

- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: |
      coverage/
      test-results/
      enhanced-test-results.json
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install husky for pre-commit testing
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run test:unit && npm run test:accessibility"
```
