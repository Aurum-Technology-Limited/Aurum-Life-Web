## 3. Pre-Migration Discovery Questions

### 3.1 Critical Clarifying Questions
The agent must ask these questions before beginning migration:

#### **Business & Operational Context**
1. **User Base & Traffic Patterns**
   - "What is your current monthly active user count?"
   - "What are your peak traffic hours and expected growth rate?"
   - "Do you have any compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)?"

2. **Data Sensitivity & Backup**
   - "What is your current backup strategy and retention policy?"
   - "Are there any data residency requirements for your user base?"
   - "What is your acceptable downtime window for the migration?"

3. **Feature Dependencies**
   - "Are there any external integrations that depend on your current API structure?"
   - "Do you have mobile apps or third-party services that need coordination?"
   - "Are there any custom authentication flows that need special handling?"

#### **Technical Environment**
4. **Current Infrastructure**
   - "What is your current MongoDB version and cluster configuration?"
   - "Are you using any MongoDB-specific features (aggregation pipelines, etc.)?"
   - "What is your current deployment environment (AWS, Docker, etc.)?"

5. **Development Workflow**
   - "How many developers are actively working on the codebase?"
   - "What is your current testing and deployment pipeline?"
   - "Do you have staging environments that mirror production?"

#### **Migration Preferences**
6. **Risk Tolerance**
   - "Do you prefer a gradual migration or complete cutover approach?"
   - "What are your priorities: speed vs. risk mitigation?"
   - "Do you need the migration to be reversible at any point?"

---

## 4. During-Migration Clarifying Questions

### 4.1 Phase-Specific Decision Points

#### **Authentication Migration Questions**
- "I've identified 3 custom OAuth providers in your current setup. Should I migrate all of them or focus on Google OAuth first?"
- "Your current JWT tokens have a 30-minute expiration. Supabase defaults to 1 hour. Should I maintain your current policy?"
- "I notice custom user roles in your database. Should I implement these using Supabase RLS policies or custom claims?"

#### **Database Schema Questions**
- "Your current MongoDB documents have nested arrays for task dependencies. Should I normalize these into separate tables for better PostgreSQL performance?"
- "I found 15% of your journal entries have non-standard field structures. How should I handle these edge cases?"
- "Your file attachments are currently stored as GridFS. Should I migrate to Supabase Storage or maintain your current S3 setup?"

#### **Performance & Optimization Questions**
- "I can optimize your dashboard query by 60% using PostgreSQL materialized views. This requires a slight schema change - shall I proceed?"
- "Your current task filtering could benefit from PostgreSQL full-text search. Should I implement this enhancement during migration?"
- "I notice potential for real-time subscriptions on task updates. Should I implement this now or in a future phase?"

### 4.2 Error Handling & Decision Points
- "Data validation failed for 0.1% of records during migration. Should I quarantine these for manual review or attempt automatic correction?"
- "Performance testing shows a 15% slowdown on complex queries. Should I optimize now or proceed with current performance?"
- "I've identified a breaking change in one API endpoint. Should I maintain backward compatibility or update all clients?"

## 5. Technical Implementation Requirements

### 5.1 Migration Architecture

#### **Data Migration Pipeline**
```python
class MigrationPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mongodb_client = MongoClient(MONGO_URL)
        self.supabase_client = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
        self.validation_engine = DataValidationEngine()
        
    async def migrate_collection(self, collection_name: str):
        # 1. Extract data with integrity checks
        # 2. Transform to PostgreSQL schema
        # 3. Load with validation
        # 4. Verify migration success
        # 5. Update migration log
```

#### **Schema Mapping Strategy**
```sql
-- User Migration Example
-- FROM: MongoDB users collection
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password_hash": "...",
  "profile": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  }
}

-- TO: Supabase users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid() PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 5.2 Validation & Testing Framework

#### **Automated Validation Checks**
```python
class MigrationValidator:
    def validate_data_integrity(self):
        # Row count validation
        # Data type consistency checks
        # Relationship integrity verification
        # Performance benchmark comparison
        
    def validate_feature_parity(self):
        # API endpoint functionality tests
        # Authentication flow verification
        # Real-time feature validation
        # File upload/download testing
```

#### **Rollback Procedures**
```python
class RollbackManager:
    def create_restoration_point(self):
        # Database snapshot creation
        # Code branch tagging
        # Configuration backup
        
    def execute_rollback(self):
        # Restore database state
        # Revert code changes
        # Switch traffic routing

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn=os.getenv("SENTRY_DSN"),
    integrations=[FastApiIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=0.1,
)
```

**3. Implement API Rate Limiting**
```python
# Add rate limiting to remaining custom endpoints
from slowapi import Limiter
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)

@limiter.limit("100/minute")
@app.get("/api/insights/dashboard")
async def get_dashboard_insights():
    # Protect resource-intensive endpoints
```

#### **High Priority Enhancements (Week 11-12)**

**4. Code Refactoring and Documentation**
- Split remaining large files into logical modules
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to React components
- Implement TypeScript for enhanced type safety
- Create API documentation with examples

**5. Performance Optimization**
```javascript
// Implement lazy loading for large components
const Projects = lazy(() => import('./components/Projects'));
const Journal = lazy(() => import('./components/Journal'));

// Add memoization for expensive calculations
const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
  return computeInsights(tasks, projects, areas);
}, [tasks, projects, areas]);
```

**6. Enhanced Logging and Observability**
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

@app.middleware("http")
async def logging_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    logger.info(
        "request_processed",
        method=request.method,
        url=str(request.url),
        status_code=response.status_code,
        process_time=process_time
    )
    return response
```

### 8.2 Long-Term Architecture Improvements (Month 3-4)

**7. Database Optimization**
```sql
-- Add proper indexes for frequent queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_tasks_user_status 
ON tasks(user_id, status) 
WHERE status IN ('todo', 'in_progress');

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_tasks_due_date 
ON tasks(due_date) 
WHERE due_date IS NOT NULL;
```

**8. Implement Comprehensive Caching Strategy**
```python
# Redis caching for expensive operations
import redis
from functools import wraps

redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

def cache_dashboard_data(expiration=300):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(user_id: str):
            cache_key = f"dashboard:{user_id}"
            cached_data = redis_client.get(cache_key)
            
            if cached_data:
                return json.loads(cached_data)
            
            result = await func(user_id)
            redis_client.setex(cache_key, expiration, json.dumps(result))
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

**9. Advanced Security Hardening**
```python
# Implement additional security measures
@app.middleware("http")
async def security_headers(request: Request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers.update({
        "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
        "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
        "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
        "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
        "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
        "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    })
    return response
