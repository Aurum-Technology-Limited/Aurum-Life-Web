## 📝 **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

**Onboarding Trigger:** Automatically activates for users with 0 total items across pillars, areas, and projects. This ensures truly new users get the full onboarding experience while existing users continue their workflow uninterrupted.

**Template Selection:** Users see all three templates with clear descriptions and can preview the structure before committing. The confirmation step shows exactly what will be created.

**Daily Rituals:** Default times are 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM as specified. These are stored in localStorage and can be customized later. The system respects user timezone and prevents duplicate prompts on the same day.

**Data Flow:** All created entities properly update the DataContext, ensuring immediate visibility across the application. The user's dashboard will show their new structure immediately after onboarding completion.

**Performance:** Static JSON templates ensure fast onboarding even on slow connections. The wizard creates entities sequentially to maintain foreign key relationships while providing user feedback.
