## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Set up your local development environment
2. Review all documents in the order specified above
3. Create a development branch: `feature/hrm-implementation`
4. Start with database migrations (Phase 1)
5. Test each component as you build
6. Commit frequently with descriptive messages

## üóÑÔ∏è Supabase Database Tasks - IMPORTANT

Since you cannot directly execute SQL queries on the Supabase instance, you must:

1. **Generate SQL Queries**: For each database change, provide the complete SQL query that needs to be executed
2. **Ask for Confirmation**: Before proceeding with dependent tasks, ask the user to confirm that they have executed the SQL queries
3. **Provide Step-by-Step Instructions**: For each Supabase task, provide:
   - The exact SQL query to execute
   - Where to execute it (Supabase SQL Editor)
   - What to verify after execution
   - Any RLS policies or permissions that need to be set

### Example Interaction Pattern:

```
Agent: "I need to create the insights table in Supabase. Please execute the following SQL query in your Supabase SQL Editor:

[SQL QUERY HERE]

After execution, please confirm:
1. The table was created successfully
2. Any errors encountered
3. If you need me to generate the RLS policies for this table

Once confirmed, I'll proceed with the next migration."
```

### Key Supabase Tasks Requiring User Execution:

1. **Database Migrations**
   - Creating new tables
   - Adding columns to existing tables
   - Creating indexes
   - Setting up foreign key relationships

2. **pgvector Setup**
   - Enabling the pgvector extension
   - Creating vector columns
   - Setting up embedding tables

3. **RLS (Row Level Security) Policies**
   - Creating security policies for new tables
   - Updating policies for modified tables

4. **Database Functions & Triggers**
   - Creating stored procedures
   - Setting up triggers for automated tasks

5. **Permissions & Roles**
   - Granting permissions to service roles
   - Setting up API access controls

Always provide complete, tested SQL queries and wait for user confirmation before assuming the database changes are in place.

Remember: The goal is to transform Aurum Life into an intelligent system that truly understands and reasons about users' life goals. Every implementation decision should support this vision.
