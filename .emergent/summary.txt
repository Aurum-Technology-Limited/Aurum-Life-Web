The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a productivity MVP, focusing on core feature enhancements and a critical migration. Initially, the work involved implementing server-side filtering and pagination for tasks, and an insights module, resolving 500 errors and frontend rendering issues in . A major undertaking was the full migration from legacy authentication to Supabase, including migrating existing user data and then meticulously purging all legacy code and database tables. This was followed by establishing a resilient refresh token flow for improved session stability. The latest work has focused on integrating an onboarding wizard with template selection and then debugging persistent Invalid login credentials and Forgot password email delivery issues, which points to Supabase SMTP configuration problems, specifically concerning Microsoft 365 MFA and SMTP host settings. The engineer has provided detailed guidance on debugging these external configurations.

The application is a productivity tool for managing hierarchical data: Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks, aiming to boost user productivity through organized planning and AI assistance. Key features include robust CRUD for all entities, consistent UI, and a stable authentication flow with duplicate email handling. It incorporates an AI service for task prioritization and a Suggest My Focus feature, and manages goals to reflect an accurate Alignment Score. The Insights screen presents an Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment with drill-down capabilities. The Dashboard offers a calendar-first view with scheduling and task filtering. Journaling supports full CRUD, search, and soft-delete via Supabase. Recent additions include debounced search with URL synchronization, quick filter chips for tasks/projects, and chunked file uploads. The current focus is on a seamless Supabase-only authentication, including a working password reset, and a functional onboarding process that populates user hierarchies without data duplication.

- Debug the persistent issue of password reset emails not being received by the user, specifically related to Supabase SMTP configuration with Microsoft 365, likely due to MFA or incorrect host settings.

<current_work>
The immediate work is focused on resolving a critical authentication flow issue: the password reset feature. Although the backend endpoints (, ) have been implemented and the frontend (, ) is wired to use them, password reset emails are not being delivered. The AI engineer has identified that the issue is external to the application's code, stemming from the Supabase project's SMTP configuration, specifically when using Microsoft 365 (Outlook) as the email provider. Debugging steps provided point to potential misconfigurations in SMTP host ( vs ), MFA enforcement on the sending mailbox, and Authenticated SMTP settings in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The engineer has also implemented a fallback to generate a  via the Supabase Admin API, which is returned in the API response, but not yet surfaced in the UI. The user is currently trying to debug their SMTP setup based on the AI engineer's detailed instructions.
