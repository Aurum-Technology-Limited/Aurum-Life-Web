The AI engineer successfully transitioned a basic React/FastAPI MVP into a more robust application, focusing on critical authentication and data consistency issues. Initial efforts stabilized core CRUD operations, fixed frontend display glitches, and implemented sophisticated backend cache invalidation with frontend consistency windows. Key feature additions included a database-backed login streak system and comprehensive cascade deletion for hierarchical entities, enforced by both application logic and database constraints. More recently, the engineer reconfigured Google OAuth to a custom backend flow, resolved SendGrid email delivery issues, and implemented a demo data seeding endpoint. The primary recent focus shifted to debugging and fixing the new user registration, login, and onboarding flow. This involved hardening backend authentication, improving frontend UX (faster transitions, success popups,  attributes), and implementing resilient user data fetching with retries to resolve navigation issues. The latest work added robust duplicate email detection during registration.

<product_requirements>
The application's core purpose is to manage hierarchical data (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) with a focus on user productivity. The initial MVP required functional UI and E2E tests, fixing critical login/dashboard errors, and ensuring Google OAuth worked.

Recent product requirements addressed by the AI engineer include:
1.  **UI Consistency:** Resolve inconsistent frontend updates of CRUD operations by implementing cache invalidation and frontend hydration (e.g., consistency windows).
2.  **Project Creation Fixes:** Address and resolve 422 errors during Project creation due to payload mismatches.
3.  **Login Streak System:** Implement a daily login tracking system with current/best streak display and a calendar visualization, database-backed with timezone awareness.
4.  **Cascade Deletion:** Ensure consistent and complete cascade deletion across the Pillar-Area-Project-Task hierarchy, displaying confirmation warnings and preventing orphaned records at both application and database levels ().
5.  **Strict Hierarchy Enforcement:** Enforce strict parent-child relationships using database  constraints on foreign keys and corresponding frontend form validations.
6.  **Full New User Flow Fix:** Debug and fix authentication (register, login) and first-time onboarding flow issues, including 401/400 errors, WebSocket failures, ensuring correct navigation to the dashboard, and loading template data.
7.  **UX Improvements for Auth:** Enhance user experience during registration/login (e.g., faster auto-switch to login, success popups, clear error surfacing).
8.  **Automated Testing for Auth:** Implement automated E2E tests for the full new user flow, verifying successful login, onboarding, dashboard access, and correct template data.
9.  **Duplicate Email Prevention:** Prevent users from signing up with an already registered email, providing a clear message and guiding them to log in.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : Updated with , , ,  for custom Google OAuth and AI.
-   : Integrated cache invalidation, streak API, stricter validation. Added  for demo data. Configured custom Google OAuth endpoints.
-   : Crucial for authentication. Modified to use Supabase  with  for registration. Hardened login fallback to legacy JWT if Supabase session is unavailable. Implemented pre-check for existing emails and returns HTTP 409 for duplicates (Email already registered.).
-   : Functions for CRUD operations, integrated cache invalidation.  and / enhanced for hierarchy and cascade.
-   : Defined data models;  and  made required. Added ,  models.
-   : Reviewed for authentication and CSRF.
-   : Stores frontend environment variables like .
-   : Main entry point, integrates authentication contexts.
-   : Manages authentication state. Modified to include retry-aware fetching for  after login to improve user hydration. Handles 409 responses from backend for duplicate email display.
-   : User login and registration form. Modified for faster auto-switch to login (1.2s) after successful sign-up and to display a visible success alert ().
-    (acting as ): Controls access to protected routes and handles redirection for onboarding. Modified for defensive onboarding gating, treating undefined  as false and consulting  to ensure onboarding wizard shows correctly.
-   , , : UI components for managing entities. Modified to add  attributes to select elements for improved E2E test robustness (e.g., , , ).
-   : Defines templates for the onboarding wizard.
-   : Contains automated E2E tests for the application.  is updated with test outcomes.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has most recently focused on ensuring a seamless and robust new-user experience, specifically addressing the registration, login, and onboarding flow.

Key fixes and improvements include:
1.  **Backend Authentication Hardening:**
    *   **Registration:** The  endpoint now leverages Supabase's  with , allowing immediate login post-registration.
    *   **Login Fallback:** The login mechanism in  has been made more resilient. If a Supabase  attempt doesn't yield a session, it explicitly falls back to issuing a legacy JWT, ensuring the frontend always receives a usable token to proceed.
    *   **Duplicate Email Prevention:** The  endpoint now performs a pre-check using Supabase Admin  for existing emails. If a duplicate is found, it returns an HTTP 409 response with the message Email already registered. Please log in instead. This logic also normalizes other backend duplicate errors to the same 409 response.

2.  **Frontend User Experience (UX) Enhancements:**
    *   **Faster Transition:** After a successful registration, the UI in  now automatically switches to the Login tab faster (approximately 1.2 seconds, down from 3 seconds) to improve flow.
    *   **Success Feedback:** A visible success alert () is displayed within the auth card upon successful account creation. The system also attempts a browser  (Account Created!) for additional feedback. Similar success messages are shown on successful login.
    *   **Duplicate Email Messaging:** The  is updated to intercept the backend's 409 response for duplicate emails and display a user-friendly message: An account with this email already exists. Please sign in instead.
    *   **Resilient User Hydration:**  now includes a  helper that attempts to fetch the user profile via  up to 3 times with a short delay. This mitigates transient issues where the user profile or token verification isn't immediately ready, preventing the user from getting stuck on the login screen.
    *   **Defensive Onboarding Gating:**  (AppWrapper) now treats an undefined  state as  and consults a  flag, ensuring the onboarding wizard correctly appears for first-time users.

3.  **Automated Testing Enhancements:**
    *   ** Attributes:**  attributes have been added to select elements in , , and  (e.g., , , ) to enhance the robustness and reliability of automated E2E UI tests.

The work is currently at a state where the authentication and onboarding flow is designed to be robust, handle edge cases like duplicate registrations, and provide clear user feedback. The previous automated frontend E2E run encountered intermittent environment issues (400/401 errors during UI tests, despite successful backend-only runs), indicating potential preview environment instability or strict rate limits. The engineer has offered to re-run E2E tests with  test emails or add client-side validation and retry logic in the E2E harness.

The immediate next step, based on the last interaction, is to decide whether to implement an auto-switch to the Login tab upon detecting a duplicate email during registration.
