The trajectory chronicles Aurum Life's evolution from a basic application to an AI-enhanced personal operating system. The AI engineer, inheriting the 0 to 1 MVP, was tasked with significant AI integration, including a Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a Blackboard System for insights, and -based RAG, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-5 nano and text-embedding-3-small.
Initial work focused on fixing critical bugs: a duplicate semantic search endpoint, an alignment dashboard data mismatch, and various authentication inconsistencies. A major pivot occurred in diagnosing and resolving frontend authentication, which was mistakenly perceived as backend failure but was a missing  stub in the React context and new user onboarding flow.
Following this, the AI screens (, , ) were refactored for clarity into My AI Insights, AI Quick Actions, and Goal Planner with descriptive UX. Further screen optimization merged Templates into Projects and created an Intelligence Hub. The project culminated in extensive documentation updates, achieving a 96% completion rate, solidifying Aurum Life as a market-leading intelligent OS.

The user's primary goal was to transform Aurum Life into an intelligent life operating system. This involved integrating an **LLM-augmented Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** to analyze tasks, projects, areas, and pillars, providing context-aware insights and pattern recognition. Key features included an **AI Intelligence Dashboard** (later My AI Insights), a **Universal AI Command Center** (Cmd+K, later AI Quick Actions) for natural language interaction, and an **AI Coach** (later Goal Planner) for strategic planning. **Semantic search (RAG)** with  for personalized insights was crucial. A smart onboarding system for new users, including a birth date field in registration, was also required. The AI model transitioned from Gemini to OpenAI (GPT-5 nano for reasoning, text-embedding-3-small for embeddings) for cost-efficiency and agentic capabilities. The system aimed for a seamless, intuitive user experience across all AI-enhanced functionalities, ultimately delivering transformative user value.
