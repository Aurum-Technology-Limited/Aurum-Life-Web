The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned a productivity application from an MVP to a robust, feature-rich system. Key development phases included establishing secure authentication with refined UX, building an AI Coach for task prioritization, and unifying daily planning on the Today view. Major efforts involved extensive debugging, resolving issues like CORS, 404s, and UI regressions. Crucially, the engineer re-architected the Dashboard to be calendar-first and developed comprehensive Insights with drilldown capabilities. The most recent focus was on stabilizing the Journal screen, initially plagued by slow loading and data inconsistencies due to mixed MongoDB and Supabase persistence. The engineer successfully migrated the Journal's data management entirely to Supabase, implementing soft-delete, trash functionality, and performance-optimizing indexes, culminating in the complete removal of legacy MongoDB code paths from the runtime environment.

<product_requirements>
The application is a productivity tool for managing hierarchical data: Pillars (long-term goals), Areas, Projects, and Tasks. Its objective is to boost user productivity via organized planning, strategic alignment, and AI-powered assistance. Core features include robust CRUD operations for all entities, ensuring UI consistency and proper data hydration, and a stable authentication flow with duplicate email handling. It features an AI-powered service for task prioritization and Suggest My Focus on the Today screen. Goal management ensures accurate Alignment Score reflection. The Insights screen provides an Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment, offering drilldown capabilities and inline actions. The Dashboard underwent a significant redesign to a calendar-first view, supporting time-based scheduling, drag-and-drop, and task filtering. Journal persistence was established with full CRUD, search, and soft-delete capabilities, now fully leveraging Supabase.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), Supabase (PostgreSQL for main data), MongoDB (legacy for Journal, now deprecated), Redis (caching).
-   **Authentication**: Hybrid JWT and Supabase authentication, Google OAuth.
-   **AI Integration**: Gemini 2.0-flash (via emergentintegrations), rule-based task prioritization.
-   **Data Management**: Supabase for all primary data, localStorage for frontend state, React DnD.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application separates frontend () and backend ().



-   ****: Core FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Defines all API routes, handles middleware, and orchestrates service integrations.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive additions of CRUD endpoints for Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks, Journal, and Insights. Fixed CORS. Crucially, startup/shutdown events for MongoDB connection were removed, aligning with the pivot to Supabase-only for Journal.
-   ****: Contains core business logic, notably .
    -   **Importance**: Implements logic for Journal entries, including creation, retrieval, updates, and soft-delete/restore/purge.
    -   **Changes**:  was refactored to explicitly use  for all Journal operations.  now filters  by default,  fetches soft-deleted entries, and // now correctly update / fields in Supabase.
-   ****: Pydantic models.
    -   **Importance**: Defines data structures, ensuring consistent data validation and serialization.
    -   **Changes**: Added  and  fields to  for soft-delete functionality.
-   ****: Supabase CRUD operations.
    -   **Importance**: Centralized logic for interacting with Supabase tables.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced  to enrich data, and  default to exclude soft-deleted entries.
-   ****: Main React app.
    -   **Importance**: Manages primary routing and component rendering.
    -   **Changes**: Switched the  route to .
-   ****: Manages authentication state.
    -   **Importance**: Handles user login, registration, and session management.
    -   **Changes**: Improved user hydration, fixed duplicate email handling, and ensured correct storage of the  in localStorage.
-   ****: Redesigned dashboard.
    -   **Importance**: Presents a calendar-first view of user tasks and alignment.
    -   **Changes**: Renders  and , removing older components.
-   ****: Daily planning hub.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes task management and AI focus suggestions.
    -   **Changes**: Unified action bar, AI suggestions display, and task addition.
-   ****: Journal UI.
    -   **Importance**: Provides an interface for managing daily journal entries.
    -   **Changes**: Removed initial endpoints being set up banner. Added a Trash tab to display soft-deleted entries, with UI elements for Restore and Delete Forever actions, wired to new API endpoints. Added a Syncing... indicator.
-   ****: Centralized API calls.
    -   **Importance**: Manages all frontend-to-backend API communication.
    -   **Changes**: Added , , and  methods. Modified the axios interceptor to correctly read the  header from  in .
-   **Removed Backend Files**: , , , , , , , .
    -   **Importance**: These files were associated with MongoDB persistence, seeding, or migration scripts no longer relevant after the full migration to Supabase.
    -   **Changes**: These files were completely deleted from the codebase to ensure a clean, Supabase-only runtime environment.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's immediate past work focused on resolving the Journal screen's stability and persistence issues. Initially, the Journal experienced slow loading and errors due to missing MongoDB connection initialization and incorrect soft-delete filtering. Although  was initially updated to connect to MongoDB, a critical discovery was made: the application was primarily using Supabase for all data, including Journal entries, with MongoDB references existing only in legacy scripts.

The core of the recent work involved fully migrating the Journal module to exclusively use Supabase, ensuring soft-delete functionality was correctly implemented. This included:
-   **Backend Refinement**:
    -   Removing MongoDB connection logic from .
    -   Refactoring  in  to leverage Supabase for all CRUD operations, specifically updating  to filter for , adding  for soft-deleted items, and implementing , , and  to manipulate the  and  columns in the Supabase  table.
    -   Adding  and  fields to the  model in .
    -   Confirming and verifying Supabase indexes (, ) for performance.
-   **Frontend Implementation**:
    -   Removing an outdated Journal backend endpoints are being set up banner from .
    -   Integrating a new Trash tab in  that lists soft-deleted entries and provides Restore and Delete Forever actions, wired to the corresponding backend endpoints.
    -   Fixing an authentication token propagation issue in 's axios interceptor to correctly retrieve the  from , ensuring API calls are authenticated.
-   **Codebase Cleanup**:
    -   Completely removing all legacy MongoDB-related files and scripts (e.g., , seed scripts, optimizer scripts) to ensure a clean, Supabase-only codebase.

This work ensures the Journal screen now loads reliably, performs smoothly, supports soft-deletion, and is fully integrated with Supabase, with all legacy MongoDB code removed.
