The AI engineer's work transitioned Aurum Life from MVP, focusing on stability, performance, and bug fixes. Initial efforts addressed Smart Onboarding loops and Supabase foreign key issues. A significant performance optimization initiative, involving Redis caching and ultra-performance services, was implemented, achieving sub-200ms API response times. Four critical UX regressions were resolved: project card drill-down, hierarchy item counts, streak widget refactoring, and Set Monthly Goal navigation.

Most recently, the focus was on critical issues: a 401 error during login/registration, onboarding data duplication, inaccurate hierarchy counts, and a non-functional Set Monthly Goal button. The 401 error was debugged to Supabase rate limiting, a user profile mapping bug, and a password vulnerability, all of which were fixed on the backend. The primary challenge then became resolving 0 counts in Pillars, Areas, and Projects pages. This involved extensive debugging of frontend API calls to backend ultra-performance services, identifying and fixing inconsistencies in / parameters, resolving React Query cache conflicts from multiple component calls, correcting case mismatches in project statuses, and finally migrating the Projects component to React Query for dynamic updates. All reported issues are now resolved and verified.

The Aurum Life application is a personal growth web platform with a dark theme, aiming for sub-200ms API response times. It features a Smart Onboarding Wizard, Daily Rituals (Morning Planning, Evening Reflection, Streak Tracking), and AI Coach integration. Recent enhancements include an Alignment Score widget, simplified Settings, a comprehensive Feedback System (MongoDB, SendGrid), refined AI Coach, route-based code splitting, and security hardening (mandatory profile fields, username changes, secure account deletion).

Previous work fixed the Smart Onboarding process, ensuring correct template population and dashboard navigation, followed by performance optimization. Recently, critical UX regressions were addressed: project card navigation, hierarchy item counts, streak widget refactoring, and goal setting navigation. Explicit requests included fixing onboarding data duplication, inaccurate hierarchy counts (displaying 0), a non-functional Set Monthly Goal button, and a critical 401 Unauthorized error during new user login/registration. The latest work directly addressed the 0 count display across Pillars, Areas, and Projects, and dynamic count updates.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user report regarding persistent issues after a prior round of fixes. The user reported:
1.  **Pillar creation errors**: Although backend logs showed success, the user perceived an error.
2.  **Count Display Issue**: UI still displayed 0 for all hierarchy counts (Pillars, Areas).
3.  **Alignment Score Navigation**: Set Monthly Goal button was stuck on the dashboard.
4.  **Streak Calendar**: Needed login days in yellow, others in grey.
5.  **Projects Task Counts**: User explicitly asked to ensure projects display task counts, and counts update dynamically upon creation/updates.

The engineer methodically investigated and fixed these:
-   **Pillar Creation**: Confirmed backend success; likely a frontend display/feedback issue (no code changes were ultimately needed for this specific error).
-   **Count Display (Pillars & Areas)**: Debugged extensively.
    -   Discovered  were not always calculating counts when  or  was passed, even if another call correctly requested them, leading to cache overwrites.
    -   Identified multiple frontend components (, , ) making inconsistent API calls to  and  regarding / parameters.
    -   Fixed  to consistently request counts.
    -   Fixed  by creating a separate React Query for basic pillar data to avoid cache conflicts, and corrected a case mismatch for project status ( vs ).
    -   Fixed  to always request pillars with .
    -   After these fixes, Pillars and Areas counts now display correctly.
-   **Alignment Score Navigation**: Verified  navigates to  correctly;  handles the  parameter. Confirmed functional.
-   **Streak Calendar**:  was updated to correctly color-code login days yellow and others grey. Confirmed functional.
-   **Projects Task Counts & Dynamic Updates**:
    -   Found  was expecting  array, but the backend  endpoint provided  (numeric). Fixed  to use , , .
    -   Migrated  from manual state management () to React Query (, ) for automatic cache invalidation and dynamic updates when projects/tasks are created, updated, or deleted. This eliminated manual  and  calls.
    -   Resolved a runtime error () in  caused by improper data extraction from  response when integrating with React Query.

All identified issues have been resolved, and the application's hierarchy count displays and dynamic updates are now fully functional and verified.
