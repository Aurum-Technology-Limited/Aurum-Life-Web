The previous AI engineer undertook a challenging migration of the Aurum Life application from FastAPI/MongoDB to Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage). Initially, the engineer declared the migration complete after addressing critical issues like user login, data visibility, and dashboard errors. However, subsequent user feedback revealed persistent and severe issues: incomplete MongoDB to Supabase migration leading to mixed database calls, foreign key constraint violations, and critical performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries) causing timeouts and slow application response. The engineer systematically debugged these, fixing import mismatches, introducing robust API clients with retry logic, and, crucially, identifying and optimizing N+1 query patterns in the backend services. The trajectory concludes with significant performance gains, particularly in the Projects section, but with a clear mandate to resolve remaining slow endpoints.

<product_requirements>
Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application designed for hierarchical task management (Pillar → Area → Project → Task), journaling, and learning. Core features include CRUD operations, sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, recurring schedules, a Today view, Kanban boards, an Insights Dashboard, and JWT/Google Auth. Key enhancements include improved drag-and-drop, a comprehensive notification system, and  fields. An AI Coach provides Daily Prioritization and conversational assistance, complemented by an Achievements system.

The primary focus of the previous work, as requested by the user, was a complete migration of the application to Supabase, encompassing PostgreSQL for the database, Supabase Auth, and Supabase Storage. This cutover involved resolving numerous post-migration issues, including:
1.  **Pre-existing User Login Failures**: Users migrated from MongoDB could not log in.
2.  **Data Visibility Issues**: Blank screens for core data (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks).
3.  **Dashboard/Projects 500 Errors**: Critical server errors preventing access to key sections.
4.  **Insights Section Failure**: Errors loading data for the Insights dashboard.
5.  **Overall Application Performance**: Slowness, timeouts, and unresponsiveness across the application, explicitly requiring optimization of *all* slow endpoints to achieve production-ready code.

The application employs a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and Supabase as its primary data store and authentication provider, having recently migrated from MongoDB.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical performance optimization drive for the Aurum Life application, specifically targeting the remaining slow backend API endpoints. This follows an extensive period of debugging and fixing post-Supabase migration, addressing issues like user login, data visibility, and initial 500 errors.

The current work identified and began to resolve **N+1 query problems** as the root cause of persistent slowness and timeouts. The engineer systematically analyzed backend logs and performed comprehensive frontend performance tests to pinpoint bottlenecks.

Key actions taken in this phase:
1.  **Diagnosis of N+1 Queries**: Backend logs revealed hundreds of individual database queries for each API request (e.g., each area fetching its pillar and projects separately), leading to 5-10 second response times.
2.  **Projects Endpoint Optimization**: The  and  methods in  were refactored to perform batch fetching (collecting all necessary IDs and making a single  call) instead of individual queries. This resulted in a dramatic **18x speed improvement** for the Projects API (from ~5173ms to ~282ms).
3.  **Dashboard and AI Coach Optimization (Partial)**: Initial attempts were made to optimize  and  by improving query patterns, but these still require further work.
4.  **Comprehensive Frontend API Client**: A  was created in  with 8-second timeouts, request deduplication, intelligent caching, and automatic retry logic to handle network instability and slow backend responses gracefully, ensuring a more resilient frontend experience. This was integrated across key components like Dashboard, Insights, and AiCoachCard.
5.  **Environment Stability**: Resolved Invalid Host header errors by removing a problematic proxy configuration from  and adding  to , restoring the application to a stable, albeit still partially slow, state.

The application currently loads the Dashboard and Projects pages quickly, and authentication works for both new and previously problematic users (e.g., ). However, the Insights, Dashboard (overall), Areas, and AI Coach endpoints are still exhibiting slow response times (ranging from ~2.4s to ~3.5s) indicating further N+1 query optimizations are required.

The next step is to continue optimizing the remaining slow backend endpoints (Insights, Dashboard, Areas, and AI Coach) by addressing their N+1 query patterns.
