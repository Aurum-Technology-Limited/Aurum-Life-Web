The previous AI engineer diligently transformed an MVP React/FastAPI application into a production-ready system. Initial efforts focused on stabilizing E2E tests, resolving critical authentication bugs (e.g., hybrid auth issues, missing user profiles), and addressing frontend display problems (e.g., logo). A major undertaking involved resolving inconsistent CRUD UI updates by implementing robust backend cache invalidation and frontend TanStack Query hydration, including consistency windows.

Key feature additions included a database-backed, timezone-aware login streak system with calendar visualization, requiring significant backend and Supabase schema modifications. The engineer then tackled complex cascade deletion for Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks, ensuring data integrity through both application logic and database foreign key constraints, coupled with clear frontend confirmation dialogs. Hierarchy enforcement was added via  constraints, necessitating frontend form validations.

Most recently, the engineer addressed feedback UI tweaks, extensively troubleshot SendGrid email delivery issues (fixing backend code and guiding the user on external DNS/Microsoft 365 configurations), implemented a flexible demo data seeding endpoint, and reconfigured the Google OAuth flow from Supabase-managed to a custom backend solution, including updating credentials and providing precise Google Cloud Console configuration guidance. The ongoing task is to ensure Google OAuth is fully functional.

<product_requirements>
The application's development began with ensuring all UI elements and buttons of a React/FastAPI/MongoDB MVP were functional, supported by comprehensive Playwright E2E tests for core CRUD operations, email, account deletion, and Google OAuth. This foundational work also covered critical login and dashboard loading errors.

Subsequent product requirements focused on specific enhancements:
1.  **UI Consistency:** Resolve inconsistent frontend display of new, updated, or deleted entities (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) caused by stale cache data.
2.  **Project Creation Fixes:** Address and resolve 422 errors during Project creation due to payload mismatches.
3.  **Login Streak System:** Implement a robust daily login tracking system, including consecutive day increment/reset, current/best streak display, and a calendar visualization, all backed by the database with timezone awareness.
4.  **Cascade Deletion:** Ensure consistent cascade deletion across the Pillar-Area-Project-Task hierarchy. This required displaying confirmation warnings with affected entity counts and preventing orphaned records at both the application and database levels.
5.  **Strict Hierarchy Enforcement:** Enforce a strict hierarchy by adding  constraints on foreign keys in the database. This necessitated corresponding frontend form validations to prevent submission of entities without their required parent (e.g., an Area without a Pillar).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has been deeply involved in several critical areas since the initial focus on hierarchy enforcement and cascade deletion.

Immediately prior to this summary, the engineer was actively engaged in reconfiguring the application's Google OAuth authentication. The user requested to switch from the previously Supabase-managed Google OAuth flow to the application's custom backend Google OAuth flow. This involved:
1.  **Backend Environment Update**:  was updated to include the new , , and  provided by the user. The  was also updated due to the user switching GCP accounts.
2.  **Configuration Guidance**: Detailed instructions were provided to the user on how to configure the Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 Client (Web application) with the correct  (e.g., ) and, crucially, the precise  (). This was done to resolve persistent  errors during Google login attempts.
3.  **Backend Service Restart**: The backend service was restarted using backend                          RUNNING   pid 48, uptime 0:00:02
code-server                      RUNNING   pid 50, uptime 0:00:02

mongodb                          RUNNING   pid 56, uptime 0:00:02
supervisor>  after environment variable changes to ensure they were loaded correctly.

Before this, the engineer:
*   **Seeded Demo Data**: Implemented a new  endpoint in the backend (, ) capable of populating the current user's account with realistic Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks, and optionally, login streak history. This endpoint was then executed with  and .
*   **Troubleshot Email Delivery**: Addressed SendGrid email failures. This involved fixing a bug in  where  was incorrectly handled, causing an . Following the code fix, the issue was identified to be on the recipient's mail server side (Microsoft 365 quarantining), and the engineer provided detailed guidance on configuring SendGrid domain authentication (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) and Microsoft 365 Tenant Allow/Block List spoofing entries.
*   **Frontend UI Tweaks**: Removed the Feedback will be sent from... text and horizontally centered the Send Feedback button in , while ensuring the button text and icon remained on the same line.

The work is currently at the stage where the Google OAuth configuration has been switched to the backend-managed flow, and the user needs to test the login with the updated Google Cloud Console settings.
