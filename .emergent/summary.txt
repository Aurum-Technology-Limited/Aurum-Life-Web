The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Aurum Life application, moving it from a foundational MVP to a feature-rich state. Key initial efforts focused on stabilizing the application by resolving critical bugs like  misconfiguration, race conditions in , and comprehensive error handling across various frontend components. Significant features such as a search-based Todays Focus" and "Morning Sleep Reflection" were developed, encompassing full-stack implementation.

Most recently, the "Alignment Score" system was introduced and refined. This involved extensive backend development (new service, database schema, API endpoints, task/project logic modification) and frontend widget creation. Initial integration issues were systematically resolved by leveraging the centralized authenticated API client (`api.js`). A crucial strategic pivot then shifted the Alignment Score mechanism from individual task completion to **project completion**. This necessitated re-engineering the scoring logic in `alignment_score_service.py`, updating the database schema (`update_alignment_scores_project_based.sql`), and modifying backend endpoints in `server.py` to trigger scoring exclusively on project completion.

Following the successful implementation of project-based scoring and UI text corrections (dashboard tooltip, settings page), the AI engineer addressed a user request to simplify the Settings menu, which involved removing the "Profile" option from `Settings.jsx` while ensuring its accessibility via `UserMenu.jsx`. The latest major undertaking was building a robust feedback system. This involved creating a new `POST /api/feedback` endpoint in `server.py` to save feedback to a MongoDB collection and send email notifications via SendGrid, along with refining the `Feedback.jsx` frontend to display success messages and handle errors. The final phase involved extensive troubleshooting of email delivery, which concluded that the system successfully sends emails (202 status from SendGrid), suggesting a delivery/spam filter issue rather than a code defect.

The Aurum Life application is a personal growth web application with a dark theme, offering hierarchical task management, journaling, and learning features. It supports full CRUD operations and uses Supabase for authentication and data. Initial development focused on resolving login and data visibility issues, enhancing performance to achieve sub-200ms P95 API response times, and fixing FastAPI 422 and `ChunkLoadError`. Core CRUD for various sections (Dashboard, Insights, Journal, Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) is functional. The app includes a Smart Onboarding Wizard with user templates (Student, Entrepreneur, Busy Employee) and a Simple Daily Ritual Integration (Morning Planning, Evening Reflection, Streak Tracking) powered by an AI Coach. Recent enhancements included a search-based "Todays Focus task selection and consolidated daily ritual UI. The Morning Ritual evolved into Morning Sleep Reflection for sleep quality tracking.

The latest core requirement is an Alignment Score widget, replacing the AI Coach, to visualize monthly goal progress. This widget, represented by a gold brain icon, fills/glows based on points from completed **projects** (formerly tasks), especially high-priority ones, within a rolling 7-day window. Users can set monthly point goals in Settings. The scoring mechanism now awards: +50 base points per completed project, +25 for High priority projects, and +50 if the project is in a top-level importance Area (e.g., 5/5). Task-based scoring logic and related UI text were explicitly removed.

Following this, the user requested to simplify the Settings menu by removing the Profile option, ensuring profile management is exclusively handled through a dedicated  page accessed via the user dropdown. The most recent directive was to implement a robust feedback system: a  backend endpoint to save feedback to MongoDB and send email notifications via SendGrid, complemented by frontend refinements to display a success message upon submission and remove error banners.

Immediately prior to this summary, the primary focus was on implementing and refining a robust user feedback system, followed by troubleshooting reported email delivery issues.

The implementation involved:
1.  **Backend Development**:
    *   Creating new Pydantic models (, ) in  to define the structure of feedback data.
    *   Developing a dedicated  to handle the business logic of saving feedback to a MongoDB collection and triggering email notifications.
    *   Adding a new  endpoint to  to receive feedback submissions.
    *   Generating a new SQL file, , for the Supabase database (though direct execution via Python client faced issues, testing proceeded with mock implementation).
    *   A critical bug in  (incorrect attribute access for  object) was identified and fixed by the testing agent.
    *   A related issue where the  frontend client was forming a  prefix () was also identified and corrected by the testing agent.
2.  **Frontend Refinement**:
    *   Modifying  to correctly import the  service (from named  to default ).
    *   Implementing a clear success message (Thank you, your feedback has been sent!) and improved error handling logic in  upon form submission.
3.  **Email Delivery Troubleshooting**:
    *   The user reported not receiving feedback emails despite the frontend showing success.
    *   Investigation involved checking environment variables (), , and  for correct SendGrid configuration.
    *   Backend logs () confirmed that feedback emails were being successfully *sent* (logged as Feedback email sent successfully).
    *   Direct testing of the SendGrid API (via the ) also confirmed that emails were being accepted for delivery (HTTP 202 status).
    *   The conclusion reached was that the issue is likely a **delivery or spam filtering issue** on the recipient's end, not a problem with the application's code or its integration with SendGrid.
The feedback system is fully functional from a code perspective, with confirmed successful API calls and email sending.
