The trajectory outlines the evolution of Aurum Life, transforming it from an MVP to an AI-enhanced personal operating system. Initially, the AI summarized the existing React/FastAPI application. The core task involved implementing an LLM-Augmented Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a Blackboard System for insights, and pgvector-based RAG. This required extensive database schema changes, new backend services, and frontend components (AI Intelligence Center, AI Command Center). The process was iterative, involving numerous bug fixes, particularly around authentication with Supabase, JavaScript hoisting errors in the UI, and an infinite loop in the onboarding flow. A significant pivot occurred in AI model selection, moving from Gemini to a hybrid OpenAI strategy (GPT-5 nano for reasoning, text-embedding-3-small for embeddings) to leverage cost-efficiency and agentic capabilities during development. The final state shows most core features are working, with specific, critical fixes identified for semantic search, onboarding, and dashboard integration.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary goal is to transform Aurum Life into an intelligent life operating system using an AI-enhanced architecture. This includes implementing a Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with LLM-augmented AI for analyzing tasks, projects, areas, and pillars, providing context-aware insights, and pattern recognition. Key features requested were an AI Intelligence Dashboard, a Universal AI Command Center (Cmd+K) with natural language processing, and enhanced task management integrated with AI reasoning. Semantic search (RAG) capabilities were also crucial for personalized insights. Additionally, a smart onboarding system was required for new users, and a birth date field needed to be added to the registration process. The AI model was initially Gemini, but shifted to a more cost-effective and capable OpenAI stack (GPT-5 nano for reasoning, text-embedding-3-small for embeddings) for development, with future agentic capabilities in mind.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories, with documentation under .



-   ****: These 9+ SQL files define the database schema for the HRM system. They create new tables (, , , , , ) and add columns (e.g., , , ) to existing tables (, , , , ).  enables the  extension.
-   ****: Stores environment variables like , , and Supabase credentials. Was created and updated multiple times to ensure correct API keys and Supabase credentials.
-   ****: The main FastAPI application entry point. It registers various API routers, including  and . It was modified to correctly include the  with its  prefix and later to include semantic search endpoints.
-   ****: Implements the core Hierarchical Reasoning Model logic. It uses the  library to interact with LLMs (initially Gemini, then updated to OpenAI GPT-5 nano). It gathers hierarchical context, applies rules, and augments with LLM insights.
-   ****: Manages the Blackboard system, a centralized repository for AI insights, storing and retrieving them from the  table.
-   ****: Defines the FastAPI endpoints for all HRM functionality (e.g., , , ). Was modified to correctly handle authentication and include new routes for semantic search.
-   ****: Handles user authentication (registration, login, profile management). It was modified to include  in user profile creation and retrieval, and also to correctly set .
-   ****: The previous AI Coach service, now updated to use OpenAI GPT-5 nano.
-   ****: The main React application component. It manages routing, global state, and integrates various components like , , and . It was updated to correctly import and render these components and handle AI commands.
-   ****: The user login/registration form. Modified to include the  component for birth date input.
-   ****: The dashboard for viewing AI-generated insights. Had a JavaScript hoisting error that was fixed.
-   ****: The universal Cmd+K interface for natural language AI interaction. Successfully integrated and working.
-   ****: Handles global application logic, including onboarding detection. Was fixed for an infinite loop issue.
-   ****: A newly created reusable React component for date input, offering both manual DD/MM/YYYY typing and a calendar popup with year selection.
-   ****: Newly created component for the frontend semantic search interface.
-   ****: Frontend API service layer for interacting with HRM backend endpoints.

<pending_tasks>
- **Semantic Search SQL Fix**: Resolve column reference title is ambiguous error in  function.
- **Alignment Dashboard Integration**: Update legacy alignment service and  to use new HRM insights.
- **API Authentication Consistency**: Fix intermittent 403 Not authenticated errors for some API calls.
- **Onboarding Template Data Creation**: Verify that new users successfully get a complete hierarchy (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) from templates.
- **Enhanced Today View Integration**: Display HRM priority scores and AI reasoning on task cards, and connect Analyze with AI buttons to GPT-5 nano.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed the integration of OpenAI GPT-5 nano for HRM reasoning and  for semantic search, replacing the previous Gemini integration. The birth date field was also successfully added to the user registration flow, complete with a functional date picker and year selection. The backend services (, ) were updated to use GPT-5 nano, and the corresponding API key was configured. The frontend components (, ) were confirmed to be loading and working.

However, during final verification, several minor issues were identified:
1.  **Semantic Search is broken**: The  SQL function has an ambiguous column reference, causing 500 errors.
2.  **Authentication inconsistency**: Some API calls are intermittently returning 403 Forbidden errors, despite successful user login.
3.  **Alignment Dashboard not fully integrated**: The dashboard is stuck on Calculating... due to an outdated legacy endpoint.
4.  **Onboarding template creation needs verification**: Although the onboarding flow itself is fixed, it needs to be confirmed that the templates (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) are actually created for new users.
5.  **Today View AI integration is partial**: HRM priority scores and AI reasoning are not yet fully displayed on task cards in the Today view.

The system is in a state where the core AI engine is upgraded and mostly functional, and user data collection is enhanced, but a few critical integrations and bug fixes are pending.
