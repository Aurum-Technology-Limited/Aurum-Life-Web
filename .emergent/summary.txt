The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative and robust development process for the Aurum Life application. The work began with foundational feature enhancements including implementing a comprehensive File Management System (upload, view, delete), which involved intricate backend (data models, services, API endpoints) and frontend (reusable ,  integrated into Project/Task views) development, coupled with extensive debugging of UI positioning, data context, and MongoDB update errors.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to the AI Coach. An MVP was rapidly built for daily task prioritization, followed by the crucial addition of an 'importance' field to Areas and Projects. The most significant advancement was the integration of Gemini 2.0-Flash via , transforming the AI Coach into a conversational, context-aware assistant. This involved several cycles of debugging API calls, data type mismatches, and ensuring proper context injection for personalized responses. The current task involves refining the AI Coach's functionality by splitting its responsibilities between the dashboard (top 3-5 tasks) and a dedicated main AI Coach section (all other queries/insights).

Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application with core functionalities in Journaling, Learning, and Task Management. It supports hierarchical organization (Pillar → Area → Project → Task) with CRUD, sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, and recurring schedules. The UI/UX includes a Today view, Kanban boards, and drag-and-drop. Previous enhancements included an Insights Dashboard and JWT authentication. Recent sprints aimed at improving Areas & Projects (templates, visualization), Tasks (sub-tasks, due_time, recurring, dependencies), Journal (guided templates, mood tagging, On This Day), and Authentication (Google Social Login). Habits and Mindfulness were removed. Implemented features now include Google Auth, enhanced drag-and-drop, a comprehensive notification system, a  field for core entities, and a simplified, flat pillar structure. The application is currently evolving with a File Management System (upload, view, delete files, 10MB limit, specific common document/image types, no sharing/organization for MVP, integrated contextually into Project/Task detail views) and an AI Coach. The AI Coach MVP focuses on a Daily Prioritization Assistant providing 1-3 suggested tasks on the dashboard, emphasizing action-oriented analysis and starting with smart notifications, with Journal analysis requiring explicit opt-in. An importance field (1-5 scale) was added to Areas and Projects for AI-driven prioritization.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a functional split issue with the AI Coach. The user explicitly requested that the AI Coach on the dashboard should *only* display the top 3-5 tasks to do today, while the main AI Coach section (likely a dedicated page or larger component) should handle all other queries and insights.

The previous interaction confirmed that the AI Coach was working contextually and conversationally, but the user identified that this behavior was not consistent across both intended locations. The AI engineer identified that the main  component was using an old, incorrect API call () instead of the newly implemented .

The current work involves:
1.  **Identifying the specific component**:  in .
2.  **Identifying the issue**: It is using an outdated API call.
3.  **The immediate next action**: Fixing the  component to correctly utilize the  for its conversational functionality, thereby enabling it to handle broader queries and insights as requested by the user for the main AI Coach section.
