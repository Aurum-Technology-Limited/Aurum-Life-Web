The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and enhanced the Aurum Life application by addressing critical bugs and implementing significant new features. The initial phase focused on rectifying configuration issues (), fixing race conditions in , and improving error handling in  and .

Subsequently, the engineer implemented two major features: refactoring Todays Focus" to an intentional search-based model and integrating a "Morning Sleep Reflection." This involved backend API development, database schema creation, and comprehensive frontend component creation and integration, with rigorous testing at each stage.

Most recently, the engineer implemented the "Alignment Score" system. This involved creating new backend services, updating the database schema, modifying task completion logic for scoring, and building a new frontend widget. Initial frontend integration faced rendering issues and critical authentication errors, which were systematically resolved by implementing robust error handling, guard clauses, and, crucially, refactoring API calls to use the established, centralized authenticated API client. The final state shows the Alignment Score widget loading correctly with a loading skeleton.

<product_requirements>
The Aurum Life application is a dark-themed personal growth web application offering hierarchical task management, journaling, and learning. It supports full CRUD operations and migrated to Supabase for authentication and data. Initial goals focused on resolving login failures, data visibility, 500 errors, and achieving <200ms P95 API response times. Core CRUD functionality for Dashboard, Insights, Journal, Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks is implemented. Key features include a Smart Onboarding Wizard with templates (Student, Entrepreneur, Busy Employee) and a Simple Daily Ritual Integration (Morning Planning, Evening Reflection, Streak Tracking) leveraging an AI Coach. Recent fixes addressed "React children error" from FastAPI 422s and `ChunkLoadError` in Journal. New features include an intentional, search-based "Todays Focus task selection, consolidated daily ritual UI, and repurposing Morning Ritual into Morning Sleep Reflection for sleep quality tracking. The latest requirement is an Alignment Score widget, replacing the AI Coach, visualizing monthly goal progress with a stylized gold brain icon that fills/glows based on points earned from completed tasks, especially high-priority ones, using a rolling 7-day window. Users can set monthly point goals in Settings.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary focus was on implementing the new Alignment Score system and stabilizing its frontend integration. The backend for Alignment Score (scoring algorithm, API endpoints for getting/setting goals, and logging scores on task completion) was fully implemented and successfully verified after the user created the necessary  table in Supabase.

On the frontend, the  component was created to replace the old AI Coach widget in . A  component was added to the  page for users to input their monthly point goals. Initial frontend integration led to compilation errors (e.g.,  icon import) and runtime errors, specifically  related to  and  on alignment scores, which caused the dashboard to hang or show Setting up your experience....

These stability issues were addressed by implementing defensive programming: adding guard clauses (), conditional rendering for arrays (), and improved UI state handling (loading skeletons, encouraging messages for new users, professional error displays).

However, a critical authentication issue was then identified: the  component was bypassing the centralized API client, leading to No authorization token found errors. This was promptly rectified by integrating  methods into  and refactoring  and  to use these authenticated API calls. This final fix ensured that the Alignment Score widget now correctly makes authenticated API requests and displays its loading state, indicating successful communication with the backend.
