The AI engineer has exhibited a highly adaptive and iterative development process, effectively responding to user feedback and debugging persistent issues. Initially, the focus was on core application features like AI Coach integration, an Achievements system, and UI fixes. A significant challenge was addressing recurring JSX errors, particularly in  and later in , which were ultimately resolved through careful component restructuring and import management. Key feature enhancements included a refined User & Account Menu, Recurring Task Configuration, and Project Templates Management. The engineer successfully debugged backend API issues (e.g.,  section data,  notifications endpoint) and critical email delivery problems (password reset). The work also involved consolidating navigation items under a dedicated profile section. The last major completed task was the comprehensive implementation of a Notifications Center, including user-controlled settings and unblocked task alerts, and fixing email delivery for password resets. The current focus is on completing pre-MVP launch features: File Management, Intelligent Today View, and Mobile Optimization.

Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application designed for hierarchical task management (Pillar → Area → Project → Task), journaling, and learning. It features CRUD operations for entities, sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, and recurring schedules. Key views include Today, Kanban boards with drag-and-drop, an Insights Dashboard, and JWT authentication with Google Auth. Recent enhancements involved improved drag-and-drop, a comprehensive notification system, and  fields. An AI Coach provides Daily Prioritization and conversational assistance, utilizing an importance field. The Achievements system offers dynamic predefined and user-defined custom achievements with auto-tracking, progress visualization, and notifications. A File Management System (upload, view, delete, 10MB limit) was planned. Recent implementation focused on fixing UI overflow in , , , creating a User & Account Menu (Profile, Feedback, Logout), implementing Recurring Task Configuration, Project Templates Management, and replacing Learning with Feedback and Support. The most recent user-requested features included consolidating account actions to the profile page and streamlining sidebar navigation, and implementing a comprehensive Notifications Center with user control (including unblocked task alerts) and ensuring password reset emails function correctly. The user now wants File Management, Intelligent Today View, and Mobile Optimization completed before MVP launch.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to the start of this trajectory, the AI engineer had finished streamlining the application's navigation flow, specifically by removing the dedicated Recurring Tasks section and consolidating account-related actions under the Profile page. This included removing the  route from , its link from , and the associated  component.

The recent work in this trajectory primarily focused on two major areas:
1.  **Comprehensive Notifications Center Implementation**:
    *   **Phase 0 (Notification Settings - User Control)**: Added  notification type to backend models, updated  models, and enhanced  to include toggles for Task Reminders, Achievement Unlocks, and the new Unblocked Task Alerts. Frontend issues were debugged, including  dependency and JSX parsing errors. The layout was later refined to remove  and excessive spacing in both  and  for consistent, compact display.
    *   **Phase 1 (Backend Implementation)**: Added  notification type. Implemented logic in  to detect and create unblocked task notifications upon task completion. Created  models. Added  to . Debugged and fixed a critical issue with the  endpoint due to duplicate methods and incorrect deletion logic in , achieving a 100% success rate for this endpoint.
    *   **Phase 2 (Frontend Implementation)**: Created  for viewing notifications, added its route to , and added  API function. A navigation item for the Notification Center was added to .
2.  **Password Reset Email Functionality Fix**:
    *   Discovered and fixed a critical issue where password reset emails were not being sent (stuck in mock mode) despite proper SendGrid configuration. This involved making  in  async and ensuring environment variables were loaded correctly at service initialization. The frontend reset URL was also updated. This fix achieved 100% success.

The application now has a fully functional and user-controllable Notifications Center (including unblocked task alerts) and robust password reset email capabilities. The user has acknowledged these completions and has prioritized the next set of pre-MVP launch features: File Management, Intelligent Today View, and Mobile Optimization.
