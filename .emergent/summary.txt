The previous AI engineer focused on bringing the Aurum Life application to a production-ready state. Initial efforts addressed critical issues like a persistent Smart Onboarding loop, achieved by using  to manage  status in . This involved fixing enum mismatches in  and , stabilizing dashboards, and resolving complex Supabase foreign key issues through manual SQL commands.

The work then transitioned to extensive performance optimization, targeting sub-200ms API response times. This involved implementing Redis caching (), database connection pooling (), query optimization (), and new ultra-performance services (), along with frontend integration using React Query (). Initial frontend testing revealed a critical regression due to Redis connection failures and database schema errors in optimized queries, leading to 19x worse performance.

Upon fixing the backend Redis and schema issues, backend tests confirmed significant performance improvements. Frontend integration of these ultra-performance endpoints then became the focus. The engineer updated , , and , and components like , , , , and  to utilize the new endpoints, achieving a 100% success rate for ultra-performance integration.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed four critical UX regressions: restoring project card drill-down functionality (), fixing broken hierarchy item counts (modifying  in  and ), refactoring the Dashboard Streak Widget to a Login Streak Tracker (, creating ), and fixing the 'Set Monthly Goal' button navigation (). All these UX fixes were confirmed with a 100% success rate in the final comprehensive frontend test.

The Aurum Life application is a personal growth web platform with a dark theme, focusing on hierarchical task management, journaling, and learning. Its core objective is to be a performant and robust personal development tool with a target of sub-200ms API response times. Initial features included a Smart Onboarding Wizard, Daily Rituals (Morning Planning, Evening Reflection, Streak Tracking), and AI Coach integration.

Recent developments expanded functionality to include an Alignment Score widget, simplified Settings, a comprehensive Feedback System (MongoDB, SendGrid), refined AI Coach capabilities (stateless, Goal Decomposition, Weekly Strategic Review, Obstacle Analysis with API quota), route-based code splitting, and security hardening (HTTP headers, input sanitization, IDOR, CSRF). Mandatory profile fields, username change, and secure Account Deletion were also implemented.

The immediate past focus was on fixing the Smart Onboarding process to ensure user-selected templates populate correctly and users are navigated to the dashboard without errors. This was completed. The subsequent primary objective was comprehensive performance optimization to achieve consistent sub-200ms API response times, which involved significant backend and frontend refactoring, including caching and query optimization. Following this, critical UX regressions related to project card navigation, hierarchy item counts, the daily streak widget, and goal setting navigation were identified and fixed.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed resolving a critical bug preventing the successful completion of the Smart Onboarding process, ensuring users were correctly navigated to the dashboard. This involved fixing a project status enum mismatch, stabilizing dashboards, resolving complex Supabase foreign key and user ID mismatches via manual SQL, and fixing an onboarding completion loop using .

The main current work phase shifted to comprehensive performance optimization, aiming for sub-200ms API response times. This involved:
1.  **Backend Implementation**: Creation of  (Redis),  (connection pooling),  (enhanced services), , and .  was updated to expose new endpoints and  to include .
2.  **Backend Debugging**: Initial backend tests revealed issues with Redis connection failures and  attempting to select non-existent columns. These were debugged by examining  and  and  were fixed to handle these gracefully and select correct fields. Backend tests showed significant improvements.
3.  **Frontend Integration**: Frontend components like , , , , , and  were updated to utilize the new ultra-performance API endpoints, and , ,  were modified for integration.
4.  **Frontend Validation**: After initial frontend integration, an 80% success rate was achieved. The remaining issues involved  and  still using direct fetch calls. These were subsequently updated to use their respective  and  services.
5.  **UX Regression Fixes**: After 100% performance integration, a new set of critical UX regressions were addressed:
    *   **Project Card Drill-Down**:  was refactored to remove the three-dot menu, restore direct card click navigation to project tasks, and add a dedicated Edit icon.
    *   **Hierarchy Item Counts**:  was updated to include  and  aggregation in the  for areas, mirroring the existing pillar service logic.
    *   **Dashboard Streak Widget Refactor**: The Daily Check-in card was removed from . A new component, , was created to track daily login streaks with a calendar view, replacing the old .
    *   **'Set Monthly Goal' Button Navigation**:  was modified to ensure the Set your monthly goal button navigates correctly to  and an Update Goal button was added.

All performance integration and UX regression fixes have been successfully implemented and verified with a 100% success rate. The application is now fully optimized and core UX flows are restored.
