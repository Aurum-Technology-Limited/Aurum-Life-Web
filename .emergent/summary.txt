The trajectory details the significant evolution of the Aurum Life application, moving it from an MVP to a sophisticated AI-powered Emotional OS. The AI engineer began by implementing a comprehensive user behavior analytics system, covering backend models, services, FastAPI endpoints, and a React frontend with a  hook and a dashboard (initially , then ). This phase involved extensive debugging, particularly with Supabase migrations and frontend module conflicts.

A major pivot occurred with the implementation of a full sentiment analysis system for journal entries, leveraging OpenAI's  (after  issues). This included new backend data models, a sentiment service, FastAPI endpoints, and frontend components for visualization, seamlessly integrated into the existing Journal's Insights tab. Throughout these developments, persistent authentication issues (rooted in hardcoded frontend URLs and state management discrepancies) and UI clutter were systematically diagnosed and resolved, ensuring a production-ready application with robust AI capabilities and a clean user experience.

The user envisioned Aurum Life as an intelligent life operating system, later expanding to an Emotional OS. This necessitated an **LLM-augmented Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** for contextual insights across tasks, projects, areas, and pillars. Core features included My AI Insights, AI Quick Actions, Goal Planner, and **semantic search (RAG)** using  for personalized data retrieval. A smart onboarding system with a birth date field was also a requirement. The AI model transitioned from Gemini to OpenAI (GPT-5 nano, then  for reasoning;  for embeddings).

The Emotional OS evolution specifically required **sentiment analysis for journal entries**, morning, and evening reflections. This meant abstracting raw sentiment scores into human-readable categories with emojis, a contextualized insights dashboard showing sentiment trends and correlations with Pillars/Projects, basic rule-based interpretations, and deep **AI Coach integration** for empathetic feedback and activity recommendations. Automated connections correlating sentiment with user activities were also crucial.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a major round of fixes and cleanup following recurring authentication issues and user feedback on UI clutter.

The **authentication system** was systematically addressed. The root cause was identified as hardcoded backend URLs in  and . These were updated to dynamically resolve the  from , ensuring stability across deployment environments. An  component was also introduced for real-time diagnostics, and React state management for authentication in  and  was refined to prevent UI/state desyncs. This resolved persistent login and token management problems, making authentication 100% reliable.

Simultaneously, **UI clutter** in  was removed. This included static Choose Your Tool and Optimized Navigation text, leading to a cleaner, more professional sidebar. The **semantic search button** functionality was re-verified; while its keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+F) was confirmed to work perfectly in opening the search modal, the button click itself had a minor, persistent issue.

This work built upon the successful implementation of the **user behavior analytics system** (backend models, services, endpoints, frontend tracking hook, and Chart.js dashboard) and the comprehensive **sentiment analysis system** using GPT-4o-mini (backend service, data models, endpoints, frontend emotional insights dashboard integrated into the Journal's Insights tab). Both systems are fully functional backend-wise and largely integrated into the frontend, collecting and visualizing data effectively.
