The previous AI engineer meticulously evolved a productivity application from MVP, focusing on robust functionality and user experience. Initial efforts stabilized core features, addressing authentication issues, streamlining API calls, and resolving UI regressions. A significant architectural shift involved completely migrating the Journal module from MongoDB to Supabase, implementing soft-delete and performance optimizations. Subsequent work concentrated on enhancing usability with comprehensive search capabilities (debounced, URL-synced) and quick filter chips across core hierarchy components. Complex features like chunked file uploads were also integrated. Throughout, the engineer iteratively identified and fixed backend 404s/500s and frontend rendering/authentication issues, demonstrating a systematic, test-driven approach to delivering a stable and feature-rich product.

<product_requirements>
The application is a productivity tool designed for managing hierarchical data: Pillars (long-term goals), Areas, Projects, and Tasks. Its primary objective is to enhance user productivity through organized planning, strategic alignment, and AI-powered assistance. Core requirements include robust CRUD operations for all entities, ensuring UI consistency, and a stable authentication flow with duplicate email handling. It features an AI-powered service for task prioritization and Suggest My Focus on the Today screen. Goal management ensures accurate Alignment Score reflection. The Insights screen provides an Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment, offering drilldown capabilities and inline actions. The Dashboard features a calendar-first view, supporting time-based scheduling, drag-and-drop, and task filtering. Journal persistence was established with full CRUD, search, and soft-delete capabilities, now fully leveraging Supabase. Recent additions include search bars with debounced input and URL synchronization, quick filter chips for tasks and projects, and chunked file upload functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend).
- **Data Persistence**: Supabase (PostgreSQL for main data), MongoDB (legacy for Journal, now deprecated).
- **Authentication**: Hybrid JWT, Supabase authentication, Google OAuth.
- **AI Integration**: Gemini 2.0-flash via emergentintegrations for task prioritization and insights.
- **Frontend State/Data Management**: React Query for data fetching/caching/invalidation, localStorage.
- **UI/UX**: React DnD, client-side search, URL query parameters, optimistic UI updates.
- **File Handling**: Chunked file uploads.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Core FastAPI application.
  - **Importance**: Defines API routes, handles middleware, and orchestrates service integrations.
  - **Changes**: Removed MongoDB connection logic. Added various CRUD endpoints, including for Journal, Alignment, and AI Coach. Implemented API endpoints for chunked file uploads (, , , ). Hardened  endpoint to prevent 500 errors.
- ****: Contains core business logic.
  - **Importance**: Houses  for entry management,  for templates, , and .
  - **Changes**:  refactored for Supabase (soft-delete, restore, purge).  updated to return empty lists on error. Placeholder  added.
- ****: Pydantic models for data structures.
  - **Importance**: Ensures consistent data validation and serialization.
  - **Changes**: Added  and  to  for soft-delete.
- ****: Manages authentication state.
  - **Importance**: Handles user login, registration, and session management.
  - **Changes**: Improved user hydration, fixed duplicate email handling, and ensured correct storage of . Added a session keep-alive ping to  to prevent timeouts.
- **, , , **: Core hierarchy components.
  - **Importance**: Provide CRUD UIs for the main productivity entities.
  - **Changes**: Implemented client-side search bars with debounced input and URL query parameter synchronization ( suffix). Added quick filter chips (e.g., status, priority, due date) to Projects and Tasks. Pillars UX updated for immediate list updates after create/update/delete via optimistic updates and React Query invalidation.
- ****: Journal UI.
  - **Importance**: Provides an interface for managing daily journal entries.
  - **Changes**: Removed initial setup banner. Integrated a Trash tab for soft-deleted entries with restore/purge actions. Added client-side search for entries.
- ****: Placeholder for file attachments.
  - **Importance**: Provides UI for attaching files.
  - **Changes**: Initial creation to resolve module errors. Upgraded to handle chunked file uploads with progress bars. Integrated into  and  create/edit forms.
- ****: Centralized API calls.
  - **Importance**: Manages all frontend-to-backend API communication.
  - **Changes**: Standardized API client exports, including named APIs like , , , , , and . Added methods for file upload () and extended  with methods like , , , , and .

<current_work>
The immediate past work involved implementing three significant feature enhancements:
1.  **Real File Uploads**: The backend now supports chunked file uploads with API endpoints for initiating, uploading chunks, completing the upload, and serving the files. Files are stored locally on the server for now. On the frontend, the  component was upgraded to display live progress bars for chunked uploads and is fully integrated into both the Task creation/editing modal and the Project creation/editing modals.
2.  **Debounced Search with URL Query Sync**: Search functionality was added to , , , and . User input is debounced (300ms), and the search query is synchronized with the URL (e.g., ), ensuring search filters persist across navigation and page refreshes.
3.  **Quick Filter Chips**: Contextual filter chips were added to  (for status: , , , , , and priority: , , , ) and  (for priority: , , , , and due date: , , , ). These chips work in conjunction with the existing search inputs and other filters.

During this implementation phase, backend smoke tests confirmed successful authentication, core CRUD operations, and the complete file upload flow. However,  and  endpoints are currently returning 500 errors, indicating that their respective backend services ( and ) are not yet fully implemented. Frontend E2E testing was blocked in the previous run due to an authentication failure, but backend login has since passed smoke tests.
