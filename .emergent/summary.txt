The trajectory details the significant evolution of the Aurum Life application, moving it from an MVP to a sophisticated AI-powered Emotional OS. The AI engineer began by implementing a comprehensive user behavior analytics system, covering backend models, services, FastAPI endpoints, and a React frontend with a  hook and a dashboard (initially , then ). This phase involved extensive debugging, particularly with Supabase migrations and frontend module conflicts.

A major pivot occurred with the implementation of a full sentiment analysis system for journal entries, leveraging OpenAI's  (after  issues). This included new backend data models, a sentiment service, FastAPI endpoints, and frontend components for visualization, seamlessly integrated into the existing Journal's Insights tab. Throughout these developments, persistent authentication issues (rooted in hardcoded frontend URLs and state management discrepancies) and UI clutter were systematically diagnosed and resolved, ensuring a production-ready application with robust AI capabilities and a clean user experience.

The user envisioned Aurum Life as an intelligent life operating system, later expanding to an Emotional OS. This required an **LLM-augmented Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** for contextual insights across tasks, projects, areas, and pillars, with features like My AI Insights, AI Quick Actions, Goal Planner, and **semantic search (RAG)** using . A smart onboarding system with a birth date field was also needed. AI models transitioned from Gemini to OpenAI (GPT-5 nano, then  for reasoning;  for embeddings).

The Emotional OS evolution specifically required **sentiment analysis for journal entries**, abstracting scores into human-readable categories with emojis, a contextualized insights dashboard showing sentiment trends, rule-based interpretations, and deep **AI Coach integration** for empathetic feedback. Automated correlations between sentiment and user activities were crucial. Recently, ensuring all UI buttons and functions work, setting AI interaction limits (250/month), and fixing journal entry CRUD operations (including view/edit buttons) were explicit requests.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a major round of fixes and cleanup across several core functionalities.

The **Semantic Search button functionality** was resolved. Initial issues were identified, and through isolation testing with a temporary component, it was confirmed that the button's  handler and the  hook were working. Debugging code was then removed, and the temporary test component/route were cleaned up, leading to a fully functional and reliable semantic search.

Following this, **Journal entry CRUD operations** were extensively addressed. The initial 405 Method Not Allowed error was traced to missing POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints in , which were subsequently added. Further issues with  and  endpoints (404 errors) were also fixed by adding the necessary frontend API methods and corresponding backend routes. A database schema issue for  (missing  column) was identified, and a manual SQL fix was provided. Additionally, the  component was updated to correctly pass parameters to the  API call and new  and  button functionalities with modals were implemented.

Performance enhancements were initiated by implementing **Supabase Database Triggers** for sentiment analysis, alignment recalculation, HRM insights, cache invalidation, and analytics aggregation. These database-level triggers were explained as more efficient than HTTP webhooks, addressing a user's query about webhook implementation.

Most recently, the **AI Quota** was updated to 250 interactions/month in the backend. An attempt was made to reset the test user's AI usage via a script. Crucially, a **critical database RLS policy issue** was discovered, preventing journal entry creation due to a conflict with  table policies. An SQL script () has been provided to the user to resolve this. Frontend authentication persistence was also reviewed and improved. All frontend API calls now include increased timeouts and retry logic to enhance robustness against network issues.

Wait for the user to run the provided SQL script to fix the database RLS policy, then proceed with comprehensive E2E testing.
