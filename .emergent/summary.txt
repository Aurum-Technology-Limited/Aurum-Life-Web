The previous AI engineer successfully migrated the Aurum Life application from FastAPI/MongoDB/Custom Auth to Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage). This involved extensive schema and data migration, refactoring backend services for Supabase, and integrating Supabase Auth into the frontend. Post-migration, the engineer meticulously resolved critical issues reported by the user. Key fixes included: addressing pre-existing user login failures by correctly migrating and aligning user IDs and password hashes across  and  tables; rectifying numerous MongoDB query syntaxes in  that caused 500 errors (e.g.,  operator); eliminating non-existent table references (, , , ) in backend services that caused dashboard failures; correcting the JWT token generation to include  instead of ; and resolving persistent  and  datetime comparison errors in various services. The trajectory concludes with the engineer confirming that all core user issues, including login, data visibility, and dashboard functionality, are resolved, declaring the mission completely accomplished.

Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application for hierarchical task management (Pillar → Area → Project → Task), journaling, and learning. It features CRUD operations, sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, recurring schedules, a Today view, Kanban boards, Insights Dashboard, and JWT/Google Auth. Enhancements included improved drag-and-drop, a comprehensive notification system, and  fields. An AI Coach provides Daily Prioritization and conversational assistance, alongside an Achievements system.

Recent explicit requests and the primary focus of the work detailed in this trajectory included:
1.  **Contextual Attachments**: Replacement of  with  for chunked uploads and associating files.
2.  **Intelligent Today View**: Planned but not implemented.
3.  **Mobile Optimization**: Responsiveness for Layout, NotificationManager, Tasks, and Dashboard.
4.  **Supabase Migration**: The core task, migrating the entire backend (MongoDB to PostgreSQL, custom JWT to Supabase Auth) and frontend to use Supabase, including its PostgreSQL database, authentication, and Storage services. This was a complete cutover, prioritizing risk mitigation, and involved resolving post-migration issues like pre-existing user login failures, missing data on screens, and various API errors impacting dashboard and project sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed an extensive series of debugging and fixing tasks following the core Supabase migration. The application's backend was fully migrated from MongoDB to Supabase PostgreSQL, and file storage moved from base64 to Supabase Storage. Authentication was shifted from custom JWT to a Supabase-compatible system.

The primary focus of recent work was resolving critical post-migration issues reported by the user:
1.  **Pre-existing User Login Failures**:
    *   Initially, only 50 users were in Supabase Auth, while MongoDB had 75. The  compatibility table had only 4.
    *   A script () was created and run to migrate all 75 users from MongoDB to the  table with their original password hashes, resolving initial login failures.
2.  **Data Visibility (Blank Screens)**:
    *   For a specific user (), despite API returning 200, no data was visible. This was traced to two issues:
        *   **MongoDB Query Syntax**: Backend  contained numerous MongoDB-style queries (e.g.,  for  fields) that were incompatible with Supabase PostgreSQL. These were systematically replaced with client-side filtering in , , , and .
        *   **User ID Mismatch**: It was discovered that data for  was migrated to a different  in Supabase than the one associated with their actual login. The  in migrated data for  was updated in the database to match the correct  ID (), ensuring data was linked to the correct user.
3.  **Dashboard/Projects 500 Errors**:
    *   **Non-existent Table References**:  and  in  were attempting to query tables (, , , ) that were not migrated to the Supabase schema. These references were removed or gracefully handled (e.g., returning empty lists).
    *   **JWT Token Content**: The JWT token generated by backend login/registration endpoints () incorrectly used  in the  (subject) field instead of . This caused API endpoints to fail in retrieving data. The  field was corrected to . The  model in  and dependent functions were also updated to use  instead of .
    *   **Datetime Comparison Issues**: Persistent  and  datetime comparison errors () were identified in , , and . These were systematically fixed by ensuring consistent timezone handling or converting to naive datetimes for comparison.

The application now supports user login (both new and pre-existing, using a consolidated email/password for existing users if necessary) and correctly displays all migrated core data (pillars, areas, projects) on their respective screens. The Dashboard is also fully functional. The engineer has declared the mission completely accomplished.
