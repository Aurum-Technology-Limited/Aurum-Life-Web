The previous AI engineer focused on bringing a React/FastAPI MVP to a production-ready state, primarily through comprehensive E2E testing and bug fixing without altering the UI. Initially, the work involved backend stabilization (dependencies,  configuration) and a full Playwright E2E test suite. This process uncovered authentication issues, leading to fixes in , , and  to handle hybrid auth mismatches and missing user profiles, alongside a frontend logo fix in .

Subsequently, persistent CRUD display issues in the frontend were identified. The engineer diagnosed a critical backend cache inconsistency in ultra endpoints, where created/deleted data wasn't immediately reflected. This was resolved by implementing targeted cache invalidation in backend services. Frontend test reliability was improved by adding  attributes. The latest challenge is a backend 500 error on Area creation due to  handling, followed by ongoing frontend display issues for Areas and Project creation 422 errors.

The overarching goal was to ensure all UI elements and buttons of an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB MVP application function correctly without errors, strictly prohibiting UI design changes. This required comprehensive automated Playwright-based frontend testing. Key functionalities to test included full CRUD operations, SendGrid email functionality via the Feedback form (using real API keys), complete test account deletion, and Google OAuth flow verification (popup opening to ).

After initial E2E tests, critical login and dashboard loading errors emerged, shifting the immediate focus to their resolution while maintaining the no UI changes constraint. This involved debugging backend authentication (JWT/Supabase hybrid auth, user profile creation) and frontend API consumption. The current state reflects successful login/dashboard fixes, backend cache consistency for CRUD operations, and robust testability, but still faces issues with Areas UI display updates and Project creation errors.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing persistent UI display issues for newly created entities and related API errors, specifically after fixing critical login and dashboard loading issues.

The core problem being worked on is the inconsistent display of newly created entities (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) in the frontend UI lists, even after successful backend creation and cache invalidation. This was initially observed with Pillars, which has since been resolved, but persists for Areas.

Recent work includes:
*   **Backend Ultra Cache Invalidation**: Successfully implemented comprehensive cache invalidation on ultra API endpoints for Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks. This ensures that  requests to these cached endpoints immediately reflect , , or  operations, resolving the stale data issue (verified for Pillars).
*   **Areas Backend 500 Fix**: Diagnosed and fixed a backend 500 error during Areas creation ( POST). The root cause was handling of an empty string , which was normalized to  for Postgres UUIDs, making the endpoint robust for both cases.
*   **Frontend Testability Improvements**: Added non-visual  attributes to key UI elements (buttons, forms, modals) within , , , and . This was done to make Playwright E2E tests more reliable and less prone to selector mismatches or timing issues without altering the visual design.
*   **Pillars UI Fix**: Implemented explicit TanStack Query invalidation and refetching on create/update/delete mutations for Pillars, along with optimistic updates. This successfully resolved the Pillars list not updating issue, and creation now appears instantly.

Despite these fixes, the Areas UI still often shows No areas yet after creation, indicating a potential mismatch in query keys or active filters. Additionally, some modal overlays occasionally block pointer events, and Project creation () is returning a 422 error, suggesting payload validation issues.

<optional_next_step>
I will implement minimal logic-only fixes for Areas UI display, modal overlay reliability, and Projects 422, then re-run the full CRUD E2E suite.
