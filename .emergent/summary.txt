The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a React/FastAPI MVP into a more production-ready application, primarily focusing on E2E test stabilization, critical bug fixes, and feature enhancements without altering UI design. The work progressed chronologically from backend stability (dependencies, auth issues) and comprehensive E2E test suite implementation. This led to resolving authentication flow issues (hybrid auth mismatches, missing user profiles) and frontend logo display. A significant effort was then dedicated to rectifying inconsistent CRUD display in the UI due to backend cache invalidation issues, resolved by implementing targeted cache invalidation strategies and frontend TanStack Query hydration.

Subsequent major features included fully implementing a database-backed, timezone-aware login streak system with calendar visualization and a best streak counter, requiring backend endpoints and Supabase schema changes. The engineer then tackled a complex cascade deletion problem across Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks, ensuring consistency and preventing orphaned records through both application-level logic and database foreign key constraints. This included implementing clear confirmation dialogs. Finally, strict hierarchy enforcement via  foreign keys was added, necessitating corresponding frontend form validations to prevent incomplete submissions. Throughout, a rigorous fix-and-test cycle with backend and frontend E2E suites ensured stability and correctness, with a focus on immediate UI updates post-write operations.

The initial core requirement was to ensure all UI elements and buttons of a React/FastAPI/MongoDB MVP functioned correctly without UI design changes, backed by comprehensive Playwright E2E tests for CRUD operations, SendGrid email, account deletion, and Google OAuth. This evolved to fixing critical login and dashboard loading errors.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to:
1.  Resolving inconsistent frontend UI display for new/updated/deleted entities (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) due to stale cache data.
2.  Fixing Project creation 422 errors due to payload mismatches.
3.  Implementing a robust login streak system: daily login tracking, consecutive day increment/reset, current/best streak display, and a calendar visualization, all backed by the database and designed for timezone awareness.
4.  Ensuring consistent cascade deletion across the Pillar-Area-Project-Task hierarchy, displaying confirmation warnings with affected entity counts, and preventing orphaned records in both the database and UI.
5.  Enforcing a strict hierarchy by adding  constraints on foreign keys in the database, requiring corresponding frontend form validations to prevent submission of entities without their required parent (e.g., an Area without a Pillar).

**Key Files and Changes:**

*    & : Store environment variables; confirmed for correct population and usage (no hardcoding).
*   : Updated to include necessary Python dependencies for backend operation (e.g., , ).
*   , , : Modified to handle Supabase token verification and auto-create user profiles for hybrid authentication flows, preventing 401/404 errors.
*   : Logo error handling improved to safely hide broken images and prevent JS errors.
*   : The main FastAPI app. Updated to incorporate cache invalidation logic for CRUD operations, new streak API endpoints (), and to handle stricter payload validation.
*    & :  implemented  and  to clear Redis cache for ultra endpoints.  functions now integrate with this invalidation on data writes to ensure consistency.
*   :
    *   : Modified to robustly handle  (allowing  for empty string input).
    *   : Enhanced to perform a cascading delete for all associated Areas, Projects, and Tasks, ensuring no orphaned records.
    *   : Enhanced to cascade delete all associated Projects and Tasks.
    *   : Already cascaded to Tasks; no significant changes.
*   :
    *   :  changed from  to required, to enforce strict hierarchy.
    *   :  changed from  to required, enforcing strict hierarchy.
    *   New models added for login streak: , .
*   : Dashboard data fetching made more resilient, first attempting  and falling back to standard. Also updated to forward props correctly for navigation.
*   , , , :
    *   **All four**: Added non-visual  attributes to critical UI elements for stable Playwright E2E tests.
    *   **Pillars.jsx**: Implemented TanStack Query invalidation and refetching with optimistic updates. Delete confirmation now lists affected child entities (Areas, Projects, Tasks).
    *   **Areas.jsx**: Implemented TanStack Query invalidation and refetching. After create/delete, a consistency window is used () with immediate hydration from standard API to prevent stale UI. Delete confirmation updated. Form validations added for .
    *   **Projects.jsx**: Create/update payloads normalized ( to ,  omission, empty  to ). After create/delete, a consistency window is used with immediate hydration from standard API. Form validations added for . Delete confirmation updated.
*   : Significantly updated to display current/best streak, current month calendar with login highlights, and month navigation. Integrated with new backend streak API endpoints.
*   : Updated button navigation to directly call  for targeted navigation.
*    & : Updated as needed for global state and context related to new features.
*   : Modified dashboard data fetching logic. Added new API calls for streak endpoints. Implemented consistency window logic to bypass ultra cache for a brief period after write operations for Areas, Projects, and Tasks.
*   : Likely involved updates to query keys or  handlers for correct data invalidation/refetching, especially with the new consistency window pattern.
*   **Supabase Schema Changes (Manual SQL Runs)**:
    *    table created: Stores , , .
    *    table modified: Added  and  columns.
    *    RLS policies (select, insert).
    *   Foreign Keys with  added to , ,  to enforce database-level cascade deletion.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the implementation and verification of strict hierarchy enforcement and robust cascade deletion across the application.

**Key implementations:**
1.  **Backend Hierarchy Enforcement**: In ,  and  were made required (removed ) to match the new database  constraints on foreign keys.
2.  **Frontend Form Validation**: In  and , the Create Area and Create Project forms now disable their submit buttons unless all required fields (name and parent  for Area, or  for Project) are filled. This prevents incomplete submissions from reaching the backend, aligning with the stricter DB rules.
3.  **Robust Deletion Hydration**: After any entity deletion (Pillar, Area, Project), the frontend now explicitly invalidates related TanStack Query caches and immediately fetches fresh data from standard API endpoints (bypassing the ultra cache for a short consistency window). This ensures UI lists update instantly and accurately, preventing stale data display.
4.  **Comprehensive Cascade Deletion**:
    *   **Backend**:  now cascades through Areas, Projects, and Tasks.  cascades through Projects and Tasks. Project deletion already cascaded Tasks.
    *   **Database**:  foreign keys were added to , , and  to enforce cascade deletion at the DB level, providing defense-in-depth.
    *   **Frontend**: Confirmation dialogs for Pillar, Area, and Project deletions were updated to explicitly warn the user about all child entities that will be removed (e.g., Pillar delete warns about Areas, Projects, Tasks).  attributes were added to delete buttons for improved testability.

**Verification Results:**
*   **Backend Regression Tests**: Passed for all scenarios: creating entities with valid parent IDs (200 OK), attempting to create without required parent IDs (422 error), and successful cascade deletions.
*   **Frontend Validation E2E Tests**: Passed. Submit buttons correctly disabled/enabled based on form validity, and screenshots confirmed this.
*   **Final E2E Cascade Deletion Checks**: Passed for Pillar, Area, and Project levels. The UI correctly reflected all cascade removals immediately without orphaned entries. Dialogs displayed accurate warnings.

The system now enforces a strict hierarchy, preventing orphaned records through both application logic and database constraints, with a consistent and reliable user experience for creation and deletion.
