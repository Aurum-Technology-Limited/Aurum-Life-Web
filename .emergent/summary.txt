The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a productivity MVP, implementing server-side filtering, pagination, an insights module, and a full migration to Supabase authentication, including data migration and legacy code removal. A resilient refresh token flow and an onboarding wizard were integrated. The recent focus has been on debugging persistent Invalid login credentials and Forgot password email delivery issues, primarily related to Supabase SMTP configuration with Microsoft 365, including MFA and SMTP host settings. The engineer implemented a dedicated password reset page and a UI fallback to display a  from Supabase Admin API. A recurring challenge was a misconfigured  causing CORS errors. The AI engineer ultimately implemented a runtime URL resolver () to dynamically determine the correct backend host, bypassing environment variable issues and resolving the network failures. A dev fallback for  was enabled to unblock testing.

<product_requirements>
The application is a productivity tool for managing hierarchical data: Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks, aiming to boost user productivity through organized planning and AI assistance. Key features include robust CRUD for all entities, consistent UI, and a stable authentication flow with duplicate email handling. It incorporates an AI service for task prioritization and a Suggest My Focus feature, and manages goals to reflect an accurate Alignment Score. The Insights screen presents an Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment with drill-down capabilities. The Dashboard offers a calendar-first view with scheduling and task filtering. Journaling supports full CRUD, search, and soft-delete via Supabase. Recent additions include debounced search with URL synchronization, quick filter chips for tasks/projects, and chunked file uploads. The current focus is on a seamless Supabase-only authentication, including a working password reset, and a functional onboarding process that populates user hierarchies without data duplication.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Core FastAPI application, defines API routes, handles middleware.
    -   **Changes**: Added API endpoints for  (with filters and pagination), , , , , . Legacy MongoDB connection logic and hybrid auth were removed.
-   ****: Handles Supabase specific authentication endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Hardened Supabase sign-in/registration, user hydration, and ensures  creation. Added , , , . Most recently, a dev-only fallback was implemented to always include  in the  response for preview/local environments.
-   ****: Main application component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to detect the  path and render the  component.
-   ****: Manages authentication state.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented resilient refresh token flow, integrated  method, and improved user hydration. Updated to use the new  for all fetch calls.
-   ****: Login UI.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed HTML entity rendering issues, added the Forgot password? link, incorporated the  fallback as Open reset link and Copy link buttons (temporary), and includes a collapsible Troubleshooting Microsoft 365 SMTP diagnostics section.
-   ****: (NEWLY CREATED) Dedicated UI for password reset.
    -   **Changes**: Parses tokens from URL, enforces password rules, submits to , and redirects to login on success. Updated to use  for API calls.
-   ****: Component for displaying task Why statements.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to address an ESLint react-hooks/exhaustive-deps rule violation, which was causing a blocking overlay on the UI.
-   ****: Centralized API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  for server-side filtering/pagination. Added , , , . Included Axios interceptor for 401 token refresh. Added temporary no-op stubs for , , , . Most recently, updated to use  for Axios .
-   ****: (NEWLY CREATED) Provides a runtime-safe URL resolver for the backend API.
    -   **Changes**: Contains  which intelligently returns  if valid and not a known problematic host (e.g., , ), otherwise it defaults to , ensuring API calls always target the correct backend.

<pending_tasks>
-   Continue debugging the persistent issue of password reset emails not being received, specifically related to Supabase SMTP configuration with Microsoft 365 (MFA, host settings).
-   Consider adding a feature flag to toggle the Open reset link / Copy link UI visibility.
-   Consider adding a toggle flag to show/hide the M365 SMTP diagnostics block.
-   Run automated backend tests for the password reset endpoints once SMTP is confirmed.

<current_work>
The immediate work was focused on resolving critical Network error / CORS issues that prevented the frontend from communicating with the backend API for authentication (login, forgot password, reset password). This was consistently caused by an invalid  environment variable, which was pointing to incorrect hosts like  or .

In response to user frustration, the AI engineer implemented a robust, runtime-safe URL resolver in  via the  function. This function now dynamically determines the correct backend URL by prioritizing  if it's valid, but falling back to  (the frontend's current domain) if the environment variable is misconfigured or points to known problematic hosts. This resolver has been integrated into , , and , effectively bypassing persistent CORS errors.

Additionally, a dev-only fallback was enabled in  to ensure the  endpoint always returns a  for preview/local environments. This allows the user to utilize the Open reset link button (surfaced in ) to complete the password reset flow, even while the Microsoft 365 SMTP email delivery issues are still being diagnosed. An ESLint blocking overlay in  was also fixed to ensure correct UI rendering.
