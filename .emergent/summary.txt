<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transformed the Aurum Life application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initial efforts focused on implementing the Pillar Hierarchy, sub-tasks, recurring tasks, drag-and-drop, and task dependencies. Critical bug fixes included drag-and-drop context, task count synchronization, Kanban issues, and complex authentication problems. Unnecessary Habits and Mindfulness sections were removed. Major recent work included integrating Google OAuth, comprehensive Journal enhancements, a real-time Notification System, and implementing a  field for core entities. Most recently, the nested pillar functionality was removed, simplifying the application's structure. The work involved systematic debugging, extensive backend and frontend code modifications, and database migrations, demonstrating a robust, iterative development approach. The current task is initiating the File Management System.

Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application with core functionalities in Journaling, Learning, and a robust Task Management system. It is designed to organize content hierarchically as Pillar → Area → Project → Task, supporting CRUD operations, nested sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, and recurring schedules. The UI/UX features include a unified Today view, Kanban boards, and drag-and-drop functionality. Prior development included bug fixes, an Insights Dashboard, and secure email/password authentication via JWT. Recent sprint goals (SRD v2.0) aimed to enhance Areas & Projects (templates, progress visualization), Tasks (sub-tasks, due_time, Today view, recurring, dependencies, reminders, enhanced D&D), Journal (guided templates, mood tagging, On This Day), and Authentication (Google Social Login). Habits and Mindfulness sections were explicitly removed. Implemented features now include Google Authentication, enhanced drag-and-drop for projects, a comprehensive notification system (browser & email), a  field for all core entities, and a simplified, flat pillar structure (child pillars removed). The application is currently evolving towards a complete file management system.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing a comprehensive **File Management System**. This feature was chosen by the user as the next priority.

The work on the File Management System has begun with the backend foundation:
1.  **File/Resource Data Models Created**: New Pydantic models have been defined in  to represent files and manage the chunked upload process. These include:
    *   : For storing metadata about uploaded files (e.g., , , , , , , ).
    *   : For creating new resource entries.
    *   : For returning resource details.
    *   : For representing individual file chunks during upload (, , , ).
    *   : To manage the state of a multi-chunk file upload (, , , , ).

2.  **ResourceService Implemented**: A new  class has been added to . This service contains the business logic for:
    *   Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources.
    *   Initiating a chunked file upload ().
    *   Handling individual file chunk uploads ().
    *   Completing the file upload process ().
    *   Performing cleanup operations for incomplete uploads.

3.  **Dependency Added**: The  library () was added to  and subsequently installed. This library is used by the  to detect the content type of uploaded files.

4.  **Resource API Endpoints Added**: New API endpoints have been defined in  to expose the file management functionality. These endpoints include:
    *   : Create a new resource.
    *   : Get all resources for a user.
    *   : Get a specific resource.
    *   : Delete a resource.
    *   : Initiate a chunked upload session.
    *   : Upload a file chunk.
    *   : Complete a chunked upload.

The immediate next action is to begin work on the frontend API client for these new resource endpoints.
