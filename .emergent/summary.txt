The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the application's core authentication and API communication after resolving critical Invalid login credentials, Forgot password email delivery, and CORS issues. Key fixes included: rectifying Supabase SMTP configuration (Microsoft 365 host  and app passwords), establishing correct Supabase URL redirection for password resets, and robustly handling token expiration and UI routing. A crucial architectural decision was the dynamic  to mitigate environment variable issues. Post-fix, a comprehensive refactoring of authentication-related frontend and backend components improved readability, modularity, and error handling. The work concluded with thorough QA testing of the refactored codebase, fixing a minor integration bug for the Insights screen, and generating comprehensive PRD, technical documentation, and changelog files, preparing the application for a GitHub push.

<product_requirements>
The application, named Aurum Life, is a productivity tool designed to manage hierarchical data (Pillars, Areas, Projects, Tasks) with the goal of enhancing user productivity through organized planning and AI assistance. Core features include robust CRUD operations for all entities, a consistent UI, and a stable Supabase-only authentication flow that handles duplicate emails and includes a functional password reset mechanism. It integrates an AI service for task prioritization (Suggest My Focus) and manages goals to calculate an accurate Alignment Score. The Insights screen provides an Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment with drill-down capabilities. The Dashboard features a calendar-first view with scheduling and task filtering. A journaling system supports full CRUD, search, and soft-delete via Supabase. Recent enhancements include debounced search with URL synchronization, quick filter chips, and chunked file uploads. The immediate focus during the trajectory was to ensure a seamless Supabase-only authentication with a working password reset and a functional onboarding process without data duplication.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Core FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Defines API routes, handles middleware, and orchestrates backend services.
    -   **Changes**:  inclusion was verified.  was modified to work with recovery tokens instead of requiring a logged-in user session.
-   ****: Handles Supabase-specific authentication endpoints.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes logic for user sign-in, registration, password reset, and onboarding.
    -   **Changes**: Initial fix for  redirect URL by hardcoding the preview domain. Dev-only fallback for  was removed. The  endpoint was adjusted to remove  dependency for recovery flows. This file was also comprehensively refactored into  for improved readability, modularity, and error handling, then the original was replaced with the refactored version.
-   ****: Main application component.
    -   **Importance**: Handles main routing and initial application setup.
    -   **Changes**: Added a URL change listener and logic to detect and handle password reset paths () even if Supabase incorrectly redirects to the root () with an error hash.
-   ****: Manages authentication state.
    -   **Importance**: Provides global authentication context to the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored into  to optimize state management with retry mechanisms, then the original was replaced with the refactored version.
-   ****: Login UI component.
    -   **Importance**: Provides the user interface for login, registration, and forgot password initiation.
    -   **Changes**: Removed the temporary Open reset link button, Copy link functionality, and the collapsible Troubleshooting Microsoft 365 SMTP diagnostics section as requested by the user. Refactored into  for improved readability and modularity, then the original was replaced.
-   ****: Dedicated UI for password reset.
    -   **Importance**: Parses tokens from URL, allows new password input, and submits to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected token parsing logic to look for . Added debug logging for URL parameters. Implemented graceful error handling for  errors, disabling the form and showing user-friendly messages. Refactored into  for improved code quality, then the original was replaced.
-   ****: Component for displaying task Why statements.
    -   **Importance**: UI component.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to address an ESLint react-hooks/exhaustive-deps rule violation, which was causing a blocking overlay on the UI.
-   ****: Component for displaying analytics.
    -   **Importance**: Displays the Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed to correctly integrate with the  after refactoring, addressing an Unable to Load Insights error due to missing API endpoints in .
-   ****: Centralized API calls.
    -   **Importance**: Manages all frontend-to-backend API communication, including Axios setup and interceptors.
    -   **Changes**: Updated Axios  to use . Missing API endpoints for Insights were added. This file was also comprehensively refactored into  for improved API layer architecture, then the original was replaced.
-   ****: (NEWLY CREATED) Provides a runtime-safe URL resolver for the backend API.
    -   **Importance**: Dynamically determines the correct backend URL, ensuring resilience against misconfigured environment variables and preventing CORS issues.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced  to be more robust, prioritizing  but falling back to  if it's invalid or points to problematic hosts. Refactored into , then the original was replaced.
-   ****: (NEWLY CREATED) Product Requirements Document.
    -   **Importance**: Comprehensive documentation of product features, workflows, architecture, and APIs.
-   ****: (NEWLY CREATED) Developer Technical Guide.
    -   **Importance**: Detailed technical documentation for developers, covering architecture, project structure, API reference, and deployment.
-   ****: (NEWLY CREATED) Version History & Improvements.
    -   **Importance**: Tracks all recent improvements, refactoring summaries, performance metrics, and bug fixes.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit user requests and pending debugging tasks identified in the initial prompt or during the trajectory have been addressed and confirmed as completed by the user. The AI engineer explicitly asked if there's anything else needed, implying no further tasks are pending.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a comprehensive refactoring and quality assurance (QA) cycle. This involved:
1.  **Refactoring Key Components**: Creating  versions of , , , , , and  to improve readability, modularity, performance, error handling, and documentation.
2.  **Integrating Refactored Code**: Replacing the original files with their  counterparts across both frontend and backend.
3.  **Comprehensive QA Testing**: Executing rigorous backend and frontend tests to ensure 100% functional equivalence and architectural improvements. The backend testing confirmed architectural soundness, while frontend testing showed excellent performance.
4.  **Insights Screen Fix**: Addressed an Unable to Load Insights error by ensuring all necessary API endpoints for the Insights component were correctly included in the refactored . This fix was confirmed by the user.
5.  **Documentation Generation**: Created three comprehensive documentation files:
    *   : A detailed Product Requirements Document.
    *   : A Developer Technical Guide.
    *   : A Version History and Improvements log.
This work was explicitly requested by the user to easily track current features for a GitHub push.
