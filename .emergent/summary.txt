The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a React/FastAPI application from an MVP to a more feature-rich product. Initial efforts centered on authentication flows, including robust duplicate email handling and enhanced user login/registration UX. Subsequently, the engineer built the AI Coach MVP backend for task prioritization and Gemini integration, expanding to unify daily planning on the Today view and simplify the Dashboard.

Significant work involved debugging and fixing regressions across the application. This included resolving CORS issues, 404 errors on core screens (Alignment Score, Pillars/Areas/Projects), and UI modal overlay problems during hierarchical CRUD operations. The engineer systematically addressed new user requirements, such as implementing drilldown capabilities for Insights, enhancing task search with pagination and keyboard navigation, and a major re-architecture of the Dashboard to be calendar-first. Persistent issues with the Journal screen's loading and data integrity were also tackled by properly integrating MongoDB. The engineer demonstrated a methodical approach to feature development, issue resolution, and maintaining system stability through continuous iteration and testing.

The application is designed as a productivity tool for managing a hierarchical data structure: Pillars (long-term goals), Areas (categories within pillars), Projects (concrete initiatives), and Tasks (actionable items). The overarching goal is to enhance user productivity through organized planning, strategic alignment, and AI-powered assistance.

Key features implemented or required throughout the trajectory include:
- **Core CRUD & UI Consistency**: Ensuring robust creation, reading, updating, and deletion of Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks, with consistent frontend updates and proper data hydration. This involved fixing 422 errors, addressing 404s on critical screens, and resolving UI modal issues.
- **Authentication & User Flow**: Implementing a stable new user registration and login flow, including duplicate email prevention, improved UX (auto-switching, success/error messages), and user hydration.
- **AI-Powered Prioritization**: Developing a backend service that prioritizes tasks for the Today view using a rule-based algorithm and integrates Gemini 2.0-flash for contextual coaching.
- **Unified Daily Planning**: Consolidating Suggest My Focus and task search functionalities into a central Today screen, displaying AI suggestions and allowing seamless addition of tasks.
- **Goal Management**: Correctly implementing the Update Monthly Goal functionality and ensuring the Alignment Score reflects user goals accurately.
- **Insights & Actionability**: Developing a comprehensive Insights screen with Eisenhower Matrix and Vertical Alignment progress. This evolved to include drilldown capabilities, allowing users to view specific tasks contributing to metrics, and enabling inline actions (mark done, change priority, add/remove from Today) directly from the insights.
- **Dashboard Redesign**: A major overhaul to create a calendar-first dashboard. This involved removing redundant metrics, adding a full-width alignment progress bar, and integrating a rich calendar component supporting time-based scheduling, drag-and-drop rescheduling, project-based color coding, project filtering, and an Unscheduled tasks sidebar.
- **Journal Persistence**: Implementing full backend support for Journal entries (CRUD, search, on-this-day, insights, templates) to ensure data persistence, and addressing performance issues by correctly initializing MongoDB connections and adding soft-delete functionality.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has most recently focused on stabilizing the Journal screen's loading and data management, specifically addressing reported slowness and errors.

The immediate problem identified was that the Journal screen was loading extremely slowly and throwing errors. The root causes were pinpointed as:
1.  **Missing MongoDB Connection Initialization**: The FastAPI application was not connecting to MongoDB on startup, leading to intermittent errors and timeouts when Journal services tried to interact with the database.
2.  **Missing Imports and Incorrect Soft-Delete Filtering**: Necessary database helper functions were not imported where needed in the backend, and the default listing endpoints for Journal entries were not correctly excluding soft-deleted records, potentially adding unnecessary load.

To resolve these issues, the following fixes were implemented:
-   **Backend ()**:
    -   Added explicit import statements for , , and  from .
    -   Configured FastAPI's lifespan events to call  on application startup and  on shutdown, ensuring a proper and persistent database connection.
-   **Backend ()**:
    -   Ensured  model includes  and  fields to support soft-deletion.
-   **Backend ()**:
    -   Modified  to default its query to , effectively excluding soft-deleted entries from main listings, thus reducing data payload and improving query efficiency.
    -   Confirmed that  performs a soft-delete (setting  and ).
    -   The  endpoint was added to allow restoring soft-deleted entries using the  helper.
-   **Frontend ()**:
    -   A non-blocking Syncing... indicator was added to provide visual feedback during create/update/delete operations.

As a result of these changes, the Journal screen should now load reliably and significantly faster, with saves/updates/deletes performing smoothly. Entries persist correctly, and soft-deleted entries no longer appear in the main view. The system is now robust concerning Journal data.
