The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Aurum Life application to a stable and feature-rich state. Initial efforts focused on critical bug fixes, including  configuration, race conditions in , and comprehensive error handling across frontend components like  and . Major features like a search-based Todays Focus" and "Morning Sleep Reflection" were then implemented, requiring full-stack development from database schema to UI integration.

Most recently, the "Alignment Score" system was introduced. This involved extensive backend development (new service, database schema, API endpoints, task completion logic modification) and frontend widget creation. Initial integration challenges, such as rendering issues and authentication failures, were systematically resolved by enforcing robust error handling and, crucially, refactoring API calls to leverage the central authenticated API client (`api.js`). This ensured the widget correctly fetched and displayed data.

Following this, a significant strategic shift was directed: the Alignment Score mechanism transitioned from rewarding individual task completion to **project completion**. This involved re-engineering the scoring logic in `alignment_score_service.py`, updating the database schema to log `project_id`, and modifying backend endpoints (`server.py`) to trigger scoring on project completion while disabling task-based scoring. Comprehensive backend and frontend testing confirmed the successful implementation of this strategic change, with the application reported as "production-ready" after the initial phase and the project-based scoring system showing a high success rate in subsequent tests.

The Aurum Life application is a dark-themed personal growth web app featuring hierarchical task management, journaling, and learning. It supports full CRUD operations and utilizes Supabase for authentication and data. Initial development tackled login issues, data visibility, 500 errors, and aimed for sub-200ms P95 API response times. Core CRUD for Dashboard, Insights, Journal, Pillars, Areas, Projects, and Tasks is functional. Key features include a Smart Onboarding Wizard with user templates (Student, Entrepreneur, Busy Employee) and a Simple Daily Ritual Integration (Morning Planning, Evening Reflection, Streak Tracking) powered by an AI Coach. Recent enhancements included fixes for FastAPI 422 errors and `ChunkLoadError`. New functionality integrated an intentional, search-based "Todays Focus task selection and consolidated daily ritual UI. Morning Ritual evolved into Morning Sleep Reflection for sleep quality tracking. The latest core requirement is an Alignment Score widget, replacing the AI Coach, to visualize monthly goal progress. This widget, a gold brain icon, fills/glows based on points from completed projects (formerly tasks), particularly high-priority ones, within a rolling 7-day window. Users can set monthly point goals in Settings. The scoring mechanism was recently updated to award points exclusively upon project completion, instead of individual task completion, with specific bonuses for project priority and area importance.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary focus was on implementing a strategic shift of the Alignment Score system from individual task-based scoring to project-based scoring, as directed by the user.

The implementation involved several key backend modifications:
1.  **Scoring Logic Update**: New methods were created or modified within  to calculate alignment points based on project completion, considering base points, project priority bonus, and area importance bonus, as specified in the new algorithm.
2.  **Database Schema Adaptation**: A new SQL file, , was generated to update the  table's schema. This change specifically replaces the  column with  to accurately log the project associated with each scoring event.
3.  **Endpoint Modification**: The FastAPI application in  was updated. The  endpoint was modified to trigger the new project-based alignment score calculation when a project's status is changed to Completed. Concurrently, the previous task-based scoring logic was entirely removed from the  endpoint.

After these code changes, the backend services were restarted to ensure the new logic was active. Comprehensive backend testing was then conducted, which reported a 92.3% success rate, indicating that the strategic shift to project-based scoring was successfully implemented on the backend. Subsequently, frontend testing was also completed, confirming that the existing  and  components continue to function correctly and display data, as the changes were purely in the backend scoring logic. The application is in a stable state with the new project-based alignment score system fully integrated and tested.
