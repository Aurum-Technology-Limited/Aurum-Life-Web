<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory for Aurum Life demonstrates an iterative, problem-solving approach. Initial work involved debugging and refining the AI Coach's functional split between the dashboard and a dedicated section, correctly switching to . This was followed by a major Achievements System Overhaul, implemented in two phases: Dynamic Predefined Achievements (auto-tracking, visual progress, notifications) and User-Defined Custom Achievements (CRUD, triggers, notifications). A critical bug emerged with the custom achievement icon picker, leading to its overhaul into a reusable, application-wide  component, integrated into Pillars, Areas, and Projects. Subsequently, significant effort was invested in resolving persistent UI overflow issues in project cards, involving dynamic text sizing, aggressive CSS constraints, and simplification of UI elements. The current state is addressing the comprehensive UI overflow fix across Projects, Areas, and Insights as per the latest user instructions.

<product_requirements>
Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application offering Journaling, Learning, and hierarchical Task Management (Pillar â†’ Area â†’ Project â†’ Task). Core functionalities include CRUD operations, sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, and recurring schedules, with UI/UX features like a Today view, Kanban boards, and drag-and-drop. Enhancements include an Insights Dashboard and JWT authentication. Recent work added Google Auth, improved drag-and-drop, a comprehensive notification system,  fields, and a simplified pillar structure. Features under active development included a File Management System (upload, view, delete, 10MB limit, no sharing for MVP) and an AI Coach for Daily Prioritization (1-3 tasks on dashboard, context-aware conversational assistant elsewhere) with an importance field for Areas/Projects. The Achievements system is being overhauled: Phase 1 (completed) focuses on dynamic predefined achievements with auto-tracking, visual progress, and real-time notifications. Phase 2 (implemented) adds user-defined custom achievements. Current focus is fixing UI overflow for dynamic content.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical UI overflow issues across multiple frontend components, specifically , , and . The user reported that text elements were still overflowing their containers, overlapping with other UI elements, and disrupting the layout despite previous attempts to fix it in .

The user provided a detailed, structured plan for the fix, explicitly requesting a **CSS-based solution** focusing on:
1.  **Component Identification**: Locating problematic text elements in , , and .
2.  **Scalable Text Solution**: Applying  properties (e.g., , ), ensuring text  and icons , adding  to text containers, and implementing **text truncation with ellipsis** (, , , ). The user specifically prioritized truncation over dynamic font sizing for this fix.

The AI engineer has already completed **Phase 1: Component Identification**, successfully locating the problematic text elements in  (Progress by Area cards) and  (Area cards, importance badge text).  was already a focus of previous UI fixes. The AI engineer is now poised to begin **Phase 2: Implementing Scalable Text Solution** by applying the specified CSS properties and truncation methods to these identified elements.

The previous attempts to fix the  overflow included:
- Implementing utility functions for , , .
- Applying more aggressive font sizing (e.g., ) and  to project titles.
- Simplifying importance badges to icons-only (e.g., ðŸ”¥).
- Adding custom CSS classes (, ) with  to  for stricter containment.
- Optimizing grid layouts and action buttons for compactness.
Despite these efforts, the user's latest prompt indicates the issue persists, necessitating the new, precise approach.
