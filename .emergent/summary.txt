The AI engineer successfully transitioned Aurum Life from an MVP state to a more robust application by systematically addressing critical bugs and performance issues. Initially, efforts focused on resolving onboarding loops, Supabase foreign key problems, and performance bottlenecks via Redis caching, achieving sub-200ms API response times. Four critical UX regressions were also fixed. The most recent phase involved meticulous debugging of a 401 login error (traced to Supabase rate limiting and user profile mapping), persistent 0 counts in hierarchy views, a non-functional Set Monthly Goal button, and onboarding data duplication. The engineer performed extensive frontend and backend investigations, correcting inconsistent API parameters, React Query cache conflicts, and a crucial data migration issue where legacy user IDs clashed with Supabase's  table. The  schema mismatch was also resolved. Finally, the Set Monthly Goal button's misdirection to onboarding was fixed by correcting the  logic to properly respect the  flag. All reported critical issues are now resolved and verified, making the application production-ready.

<product_requirements>
The Aurum Life application is a personal growth web platform featuring a dark theme, designed for sub-200ms API response times. Key functionalities include a Smart Onboarding Wizard, Daily Rituals (Morning Planning, Evening Reflection, Streak Tracking), and AI Coach integration. Recent enhancements incorporated an Alignment Score widget, streamlined Settings, a comprehensive Feedback System (MongoDB, SendGrid), and enhanced security (mandatory profile fields, username changes, secure account deletion).

The previous development focused on stabilizing the Smart Onboarding process, ensuring correct template population and dashboard navigation, followed by performance optimization. Recently, critical UX issues were identified: project card navigation, inaccurate hierarchy item counts, streak widget refactoring, and goal setting navigation. Explicit user requests targeted fixing onboarding data duplication, 0 counts for Pillars and Areas, a non-functional Set Monthly Goal button, and a critical 401 Unauthorized error during new user login/registration. The latest work successfully resolved the 0 count display across Pillars, Areas, and Projects, and dynamic count updates, making the application production-ready.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved several critical issues reported by the user, making the application production-ready.

The key problems and their solutions were:
1.  **Foreign Key Constraint Violation**: Onboarding template application was failing with Failed to apply template due to user IDs in the legacy  table not existing in Supabase's , causing foreign key issues when creating pillars. The fix involved creating and executing , which migrated the user from the legacy  table to , updated all references, and created a proper  entry. This was verified by successful pillar creation.

2.  **Schema Mismatch in Query Optimizer**: HTTP 500 errors on  were preventing the dashboard from loading. This was caused by  universally applying  sorting, which the  table lacked. The fix involved modifying  (line 157) to conditionally apply  only to relevant tables (, , , ), using  for others.

3.  **Incorrect Onboarding Logic in OptimizedDashboard**: The Set Monthly Goal button was unexpectedly triggering the onboarding wizard instead of navigating to settings. This was due to  checking if the user had any data (pillars/areas/projects) and showing onboarding if not, completely ignoring the  flag. The fix involved modifying  to import , and updating its  function to only show onboarding if the user has no data *AND* has not yet completed onboarding, respecting the  status.

4.  **User Fallback Logic in Ultra Performance Services**: The ultra dashboard service was failing if the user was not found in the  table. The solution was to enhance  with a robust fallback mechanism that attempts to fetch user data from the  table (for legacy users) using  if not found in .

All these fixes have been successfully implemented and verified, confirming that core user flows (onboarding, dashboard loading, navigation, and data creation) are now functional and stable.
