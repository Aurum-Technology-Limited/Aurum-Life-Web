The previous AI engineer successfully executed a comprehensive migration of the Aurum Life application from a FastAPI + MongoDB + Custom Auth architecture to a Supabase-powered solution. This involved a multi-phase approach, starting with environment setup and schema design, followed by authentication migration, core data migration, backend API integration, and finally, frontend integration. The engineer addressed several challenges, including database connection errors, foreign key constraints, and datetime serialization issues, iteratively debugging and resolving them. The final phase involved migrating the file storage system from base64 in MongoDB to Supabase Storage, significantly improving efficiency. Despite achieving 100% completion in various migration aspects, the very last interaction indicates a critical outstanding issue: pre-existing user data and authentication from before the migration might not have been transferred or integrated correctly, as the user reported being unable to log in with old credentials.

Aurum Life is a dark-themed personal growth web application designed for hierarchical task management (Pillar → Area → Project → Task), journaling, and learning. It supports CRUD operations, sub-tasks, dependencies, reminders, and recurring schedules. Key features include a Today view, Kanban boards, Insights Dashboard, and JWT/Google Auth. Existing enhancements involved improved drag-and-drop, a comprehensive notification system, and  fields. An AI Coach provides Daily Prioritization and conversational assistance, alongside an Achievements system.

Recent explicit requests prior to this trajectory included consolidating account actions, streamlining sidebar navigation, implementing a comprehensive Notifications Center with user control, and ensuring password reset emails function correctly. The primary focus of the work detailed in this trajectory was a major architectural migration to Supabase, encompassing:
1.  **Contextual Attachments (lean File Management)**: Replacing  with  component, supporting chunked uploads and associating files with projects/tasks.
2.  **Intelligent Today View**: Planned but not fully implemented within this trajectory.
3.  **Mobile Optimization**: Ensuring responsiveness across devices for key components like Layout, NotificationManager, Tasks, and Dashboard.
4.  **Supabase Migration**: The core task, migrating the entire backend (MongoDB to PostgreSQL, custom JWT to Supabase Auth) and frontend to use Supabase, including its PostgreSQL database, authentication, and Storage services. This was a complete cutover, prioritizing risk mitigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the extensive Supabase migration for the Aurum Life application. This multi-phase effort transformed the application's backend from a MongoDB-based system with custom JWT authentication and base64 file storage to a modern Supabase stack utilizing PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, and Supabase Storage.

**Key areas of work completed and their current state:**

1.  **Database Migration (MongoDB to Supabase PostgreSQL)**:
    *   **Schema**: A comprehensive 14-table PostgreSQL schema () was designed, including , , , , , , , , etc., with proper UUIDs, foreign keys, and indexes. A compatibility  table was added via  to resolve backend authentication dependencies.
    *   **Data Migration**: Existing MongoDB data was successfully migrated to the new Supabase PostgreSQL tables using custom Python scripts like  and .
    *   **Status**: 100% complete and verified; all core data is now in Supabase.

2.  **Backend Integration with Supabase**:
    *   **Supabase Client**: A new  was created to abstract all database operations, replacing direct MongoDB calls in .
    *   **API Endpoints**: All major API endpoints (, , , , , ) in  and  were updated to interact with Supabase.
    *   **Startup/Shutdown**: Server startup/shutdown events were modified to connect/disconnect to Supabase.
    *   **Status**: 100% complete and verified; the backend successfully performs all CRUD operations via Supabase.

3.  **Authentication System**:
    *   The legacy custom JWT authentication system was replaced with a Supabase-compatible approach.
    *   **Backend**:  was introduced, and  was updated to handle user registration and login, generating JWT tokens that the backend can validate for Supabase-stored users.
    *   **Frontend**:  was created to handle user authentication (login, register, forgot password) using Supabase Auth features, replacing the old . The  component was updated to use this new context.
    *   **Status**: 100% complete; registration, login, and JWT token handling are functional with Supabase.

4.  **File Storage Migration (Base64 in MongoDB to Supabase Storage)**:
    *   **Buckets**: Four Supabase Storage buckets (, , , ) were created via .
    *   **Backend Service**: A new  was implemented to handle file uploads (from base64), secure URL generation, and deletion using Supabase Storage.
    *   **API Endpoints**: Resource-related API endpoints in  were updated to use the new storage service. A migration endpoint () was added.
    *   **Frontend Component**:  was comprehensively updated to support drag-and-drop uploads, display file lists, and manage file actions through the Supabase-integrated backend.
    *   **Schema Update**: The  table in Supabase was updated () to include , , and  columns.
    *   **Status**: 100% complete and verified; files are now efficiently stored and managed via Supabase Storage.

**Remaining Nuance:**
Despite all components reporting 100% complete, the final user message (I just tried logging in with the credentials I had from before the migration and nothing happened. Did you transfer preexisiting users and data as well or not?) indicates a critical unresolved issue with *pre-existing user migration* from the original MongoDB database to the new Supabase Auth system. While the current system handles new registrations and logins, the migration of historical user accounts and their associated password hashes/credentials was not fully verified or completed, leading to a break in continuity for existing users.
